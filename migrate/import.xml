        <title>RWNZ supports pet calf project 29-Apr-2011</title>
        <date>Friday, April 29, 2011</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/2012_1125Flaxmeremahia0002_New.jpg" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; width: 200px; height: 151px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><br> Rural children might take raising a pet calf for granted, but for twenty-one children from Flaxmere primary, a decile one school near Hastings, the chance to look after their own calf has been the experience of a lifetime.</p> 
<br> It’s been an experience that Rural Women New Zealand members from Korokipo branch have enjoyed sharing with the children, as they spend one day each week at the farm of Eliot and Mary Cooper at Takapau, learning to feed, groom and lead their calves.
<br> 
<br> Eliot Cooper came up with the idea of giving children from lower decile schools the opportunity to have a hands-on experience of rural life as a way of giving something back to the industry.
<br> 
<br> Mary says at first some of the children were afraid of the animals and worried about getting dirty, but with encouragement from the Coopers and the Rural Women volunteers, they have blossomed.
<br> 
<br> “The children’s development in leading the calves has been amazing,” says Mary Cooper. &nbsp;“If you saw the children your heart would melt.”
<br> 
<br> During the farm visits the children also help feed pet lambs, and see other aspects of the farming operation such as the pigs, horses and farm dogs. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The Rural Women members prepare hearty farm lunches for the children and help them groom and lead their calves.
<br> 
<br> Fonterra has also supported the project, giving milk for the children’s lunches and providing halters for the 23 calves.
<br> 
<br> 
<p>Next the calves will be heading off to Flaxmere school for a calf club day organized by the Coopers. &nbsp;With two show rings, the children will parade their calves and compete for cups and ribbons for leading, care and attention and champion calf. &nbsp;</p> 
<br> At school the children have kept calf diaries and decorated their calf covers, which will also be judged.
<br> 
<br> Now Eliot hopes to make the calf rearing project an annual event and expand it to other schools. &nbsp;

        <body><![CDATA[<p>Wow! Over 6,000 pairs sold in less than three weeks! This has meant the NZ Sock Company is working very hard to keep up, and we do thank everyone for their patience if you are having to wait a little longer for orders. It’s also meant a huge logistical exercise in our national office processing the accounts and sending out all the orders. We’ve been helped in this by Bridget Evans, our president’s daughter, without whom we would never have coped!</p> 
<p>If you want to read all the wonderful feedback we’ve been getting, check out the aftersocks Facebook page, which now has almost 3,000 people following us.</p> 
<p>Interestingly 80% of the socks have been sold in Canterbury or are being bought for Cantabrians and sent to them, so we really are warming hearts, warming toes and warming Cantabrians with this project.</p> 
<p>The aftersocks website is where you can go to order a pair www.aftersocks.co.nz. This website had over 100,000 hits in one day!</p> 
<h3>RWNZ Branches can also order aftersocks under the special members’ bulk order offer:</h3> 
<p>50 pairs of aftersocks @$17 per pair plus postage and packaging of $10.50 = $860.50. To order in bulk contact National Office – email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="16737867637f647f736556646364777a61797b73783879647138786c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> and put aftersocks in the subject line. (If members decide to on-sell at the full price of $20 a pair, they can use the extra funds raised for their own Canterbury earthquake project.)</p>]]></body>

        <date>Monday, July 11, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>A vibrant group of women from Top of the South came together last weekend at St Arnaud for a leadership training programme, sponsored by Landcorp. The weather was chilly (minus 7 degrees on Sunday morning!) but inside the lovely new St Arnaud hall the atmosphere was warm and buzzing!</p> 
<p>We heard from inspiring leaders John Ayling (chair of Access) and Suzanne Win, as well as presentations from Liz Evans and Jackie Edkins about RWNZ, and thought-provoking discussions led by Heather Sorenson, Sue Higgins and Michelle Reilly.</p> 
<p>Hilarious after dinner entertainment was provided by bush poet and balladeer, Roger Lusby.</p> 
<p>We have further Leadership Experience events sponsored by Landcorp coming up. On Monday/Tuesday 11/12 July in Region 6 (Waikato/Taranaki) the first of these will be held at the Kingsgate Hotel in Hamilton.

        <title>The Taste of Success 02-Aug-2011</title>
        <date>Tuesday, August 02, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/201108_lisaharper_blog.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/201108_lisaharper_blog.jpg" style="border: 0px;"><br> <br> Making cheese is something the Harper women have done for generations, originally bringing their skills to New Zealand from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, the home of English stilton cheese.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> It’s been a recipe for success, which culminated in Lisa Harper taking away the Supreme Winner trophy at the RWNZ Enterprising Rural Women Award 2011 during our national conference in Auckland in May.</p> 
<p> Lisa learned cheese making from her grandmother and mother.&nbsp; Growing up it was just another regular household task, "It's like vacuuming.&nbsp; Cheese and I have grown up together!”</p> 
<p> Lisa spent her childhood on the family farm at the head of the Mahau Sounds in Marlborough, and received her education through The Correspondence School, before setting off to Wellington to do a science degree.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> She began her working life travelling the country as a research scientist, but returned to the farm eight years ago to help out ‘for a few months’.&nbsp; It became a labour of love, and Lisa has transformed the flagging fortunes of the sheep farm by developing cheese making into a business to compliment the farm stay accommodation she and her mother run.</p> 
<p> Lisa says she loves feeding people, and her farm guests were often fascinated by the cheeses she served at dinner and wanted to see how it was made.&nbsp; Quick to see a new business opportunity, Lisa now runs cheese making classes that even-out the seasonal cash flow, attracting guests to Sherrington Grange all year round.</p> 
<p> Lisa’s also a regular at the Marlborough Farmers’ Market, where people are treated to tastings of her cheese.&nbsp; “I get to feed people for three hours. It's like a weekly date."</p> 
<p> Lisa describes her range of cheeses as mild, medium, and "deadly", depending on how long they age for. </p> 
<p> “I consider myself a cheese ager, not a cheese maker, because my job is to make sure the cheese ages properly and develops to what it's supposed to."</p> 
<p> Back on the farm the cheese making process continues through the week. “We lovingly coax fresh milk into cheese in our tiny farm dairy from recipes more than two centuries old,” says Lisa.&nbsp; “Each cheese is hand-crafted using traditional methods which have been discarded by modern dairy factories in the quest for efficiency.</p> 
<p> “We choose to make only limited quantities of cheese, using the old ways, because we believe it creates a better product - this is the way cheese was before mechanisation and standardisation became the norm. Sherrington cheeses look, smell and taste the way they were meant to.”</p> 
<p> Like many of our entrants this year, Lisa was encouraged to enter the RWNZ Enterprising Rural Women Award by one of our members, and giving recognition to rural women entrepreneurs achieving extraordinary things is a key reason for our running the Award.</p> 
<p> Lisa’s win has received extensive publicity on TV, in provincial and farming newspapers and trade journals, as well as from overseas publications such as the USA goat industry magazine, and is an excellent way of promoting our organisation.</p> 
<p> Runners up in the Award were North Island winners Nestling Limited, run by sisters Bernadine Guilleux and Maria-Fe Rohrlach.&nbsp; Their Rotorua-based business makes baby slings and pouches from merino wool and organic cotton.&nbsp; The judges were particularly impressed with the business’ use of New Zealand raw materials, as well as their online marketing strategies which connect them in a very personal way with their customers. </p> 
<p> We thank our Award co-sponsors, Access Homehealth Ltd and Telecom for their support.</p> 
<p> For more information on our winners go to <a href="http://www.sherringtongrange.co.nz/">www.sherringtongrange.co.nz</a> and <a href="http://www.nestling.co.nz/">www.nestling.co.nz</a></p>]]></body>

        <title>Knitting Communities Together 03-Aug-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 03, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/blog/20110803_knitting.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p> <img alt="" src="/images/blog/20110803_knitting.jpg" style="width: 260px; height: 476px; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; border: 0px solid;">There has been a heart-warming response to our Communities Knitting Together project to support Cantabrians after the earthquakes, with donations pouring in from members and friends all over the country.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Thousands of warm knitted items have been distributed to those in need.</p> 
<p> Canterbury councillor, Kerry Maw, has delivered several mini-van loads of beautifully-knitted warm items to community, church and school contacts who’ve been giving them out as quickly as they’ve arrived.</p> 
<p> “Some of the women had tears in their eyes, they were so overwhelmed,” says Kerry.</p> 
<p> Groups who’ve helped distribute the knitting include Birthright, the Salvation Army, the Aranui Community Trust and the Dallington Hub Community Group.&nbsp; “They have been blown away by the support,” says Kerry.</p> 
<p> The mountains of knitting included hats, scarves, jerseys, booties and slippers, as well as knee rugs and peggy square blankets.</p> 
<p> The project has united communities, just as Kerry hoped it would.</p> 
<p> “I knew there would be a really good response, but I was surprised at just how much people got into it!”&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Alongside Rural Women New Zealand knitters, items have been received from spinners and weavers clubs, Lions and community craft groups.</p> 
<p> Cathy from the Aranui Community Trust says the items have been given directly to families in need through their nurses and earthquake co-ordinators, as well as through church groups that the Trust links in with.</p> 
<p> “Families are over the moon because it’s really cold here.”</p> 
<p> All the items Aranui’s received from our Communities Knitting Together project have been given out, and more can still be used says Cathy.&nbsp; She says hundreds of beanies and babies bonnets have been distributed.&nbsp; “Jerseys go as fast as they come in.”</p> 
<p> While our Communities Knitting Together project has now finished, if anyone would like to continue knitting for those in need in Christchurch, we have a list of community groups where items can be sent directly.&nbsp; Please contact national office for details.</p> 
<p>[In a box]&nbsp; Margaret Townsend of Piako-Waikato East provincial promoted the Communities Knitting Together project by word of mouth and through her local community newspaper and was amazed at the number of items she received.</p> 
<p> A mammoth one hundred and eight boxes were filled with knitting, blankets and warm clothing that arrived from neighbours, friends, family and the wider community.&nbsp; A local carrier transported the knitting and clothing to Canterbury free of charge.&nbsp; Many of the donations simply arrived on Margaret’s doorstep, but she also drove to places she’s never been before to pick up knitting, she says.&nbsp; “I am sure [the great response] was because we were Rural Women.&nbsp; It was absolutely brilliant.”</p> [In a box]&nbsp; In Tauranga, members decided to support Glassons’ project to sell black and red scarves as a Canterbury earthquake fundraiser.&nbsp; “We have so far knitted 25 red and black scarves,” says Mary McTavish.&nbsp; “As well as this we have been busy knitting supporting the “Communities Knitting Together” campaign.&nbsp; We delivered to the local Red Cross offices in Tauranga 280 items of hand knitting including teddy bears, beanies, hats, scarves, slippers and children’s jumpers.”&nbsp; Great work Tauranga members!

        <title>Let's Get Plastered 03-Aug-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 03, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/blog/20110803_plastered.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/20110803_plastered.jpg" style="width: 260px; height: 324px; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; border: 0px solid;">A jumbo cheque presentation to the NZ Breast Cancer Foundation at National Conference 2011 was a fitting finale to our wonderful Let’s Get Plastered for Breast Cancer campaign.<br> We sold 1600 plastering kits and members held more than 20 events around the country to display the colourful breast sculptures produced by creative members, to promote breast cancer awareness.</p> 
<p> Our campaign raised $16,000 for the Foundation.&nbsp; Their Chief Executive Evangelia Henderson thanked Rural Women for the amazing support and said the funds would go to a worthy cause that will help many rural women in the future.&nbsp; The money is to be used for a research project being conducted at Otago Univesity by Associate Professor Susan Dovey, who is comparing the outcomes for rural women versus urban women who suffer from breast cancer, and the different treatment choices they make. </p>]]></body>

        <title>Cooking up a storm to feed the Farmy Army 03-Aug-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 03, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/blog/20110803_farmyarmy.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/20110803_farmyarmy.jpg" style="border: 0px;"><br> <br> When ‘Farmy Army’ members rolled up their sleeves to clean up the liquefaction in Christchurch after the June earthquake, RWNZ member Helen Heddell also launched into action to organise the catering crews to ensure no-one was working on an empty stomach.</p> 
<p> By the end of the week she’d co-ordinated the cooking of 1200 hot dinners, been up at dawn to cook breakfast for the volunteers and arranged packed lunches for the hundreds of workers as they left for another long day shovelling silt.</p> 
<p> Helen says ‘don’t ask how my feet are!’ but otherwise she’s very happy with the support she and caterer Nicki Geddes have had for the huge logistical exercise.</p> 
<p> She says lessons learnt from the clean up in February helped.&nbsp; “We have simplified it right down,” </p> 
<p> For a week Helen’s day began at 7am at the Canterbury Showgrounds cooking omelettes, bacon and muffins for those who camped overnight.</p> 
<p> 20 women then turned up each day to help with whatever was required.&nbsp; They began by making packed lunches for the Student Volunteers and the Farmy Army, who set out with wheelbarrows, diggers and bobcats to clean up the grey liquefaction that covered many of the city’s streets and gardens.</p> 
<p> “Rural women have been very supportive,” says Helen, with many city folk pitching in as well. “We had 12 women from Oamaru and a group from Hawke’s Bay turned up out of the woodwork.”</p> 
<p> The amount of baking that came in was ‘phenomenal’.&nbsp; “It is amazing, we have four wheel drives turning up every half hour full of it.”&nbsp; Two transport companies and one stock firm collected baking from as far afield as Southland.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Mid-afternoon, preparation for the evening meal began, with hearty food on the menu.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Helen arranged sponsorship of the meat from the meat companies and processors, as she did for the February clean up.&nbsp; “They have been fantastic.&nbsp; People have just been so good.”</p>]]></body>

        <title>Rock Those Socks 03-Aug-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 03, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/blog/20110803_aftersocks.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/20110803_aftersocks.jpg" style="width: 260px; height: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; border: 0px solid;">Wow!&nbsp; In the first week since our launch, 100,000 people visited our <strong><a href="http://www.aftersocks.co.nz/" target="_blank" class="rw-blue1">aftersocks</a></strong>™ website and thousands of comments were posted on our <strong><a href="http://www.aftersocks.co.nz/" target="_blank" class="rw-blue1">aftersocks</a></strong>™ Facebook page, congratulating us on this wonderful fundraiser to support the Christchurch Mayoral Fund.&nbsp; We increased our sock order with the NZ Sock Company in Ashburton several times over, and still we’ll be struggling to meet demand as <strong><a href="http://www.aftersocks.co.nz/" target="_blank" class="rw-blue1">aftersocks</a></strong>™ goes global.</p> 
<p> When you get your pair of <strong><a href="http://www.aftersocks.co.nz/" target="_blank" class="rw-blue1">aftersocks</a></strong>™ don’t forget to send in photos of the awesome places you’ve worn them by for our ‘Quaking in Your <strong><a href="http://www.aftersocks.co.nz/" target="_blank" class="rw-blue1">aftersocks</a></strong>™’ photo competition.&nbsp; Upload your photos and tag yourself on Facebook, to be in to win one of several photographic prize packs that have been donated by photographers across the country.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://www.aftersocks.co.nz/" target="_blank" class="rw-blue1">aftersocks</a></strong>™ can be purchased through <a href="http://www.aftersocks.co.nz/" target="_blank" class="rw-blue1">www.aftersocks.co.nz</a>.</p> 
<p>On a more sobering note, feedback from Christchurch is that with the ongoing earthquakes and thousands of aftershocks, stress levels are now very high leading to abuse, depression, violence and bullying.</p> 
<p> After the September 3rd earthquake members raised $10,000 to support people affected by the earthquake.&nbsp; Following the February 22 earthquake this amount swelled to $20,000 with a generous donation from the Queensland Country Women’s Association of $8469.&nbsp; The South Australia Country Women’s Association International Committee also gifted $1,000 for knitting wool for garments to be sent to Christchurch.&nbsp; We thank both groups for their fantastic support.&nbsp; We are working through the process of how this funding will be put to best use.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Green ribbon awards 03-Aug-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 03, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>We congratulate the <strong>NZ Landcare Trust</strong>, which received top honours in the <strong>‘Caring for our Water’</strong> category in the 2011 Green Ribbon Awards, announced at Parliament in June.</p> 
<p> Rural Women New Zealand is one of seven trustees on the NZ Landcare Trust Board and many RWNZ members work at grass roots level alongside the Trust. </p> 
<p> The Trust works with farmers, landowners and community groups to improve the sustainability of our landscapes and waterways.</p> 
<p> Minister for the Environment, Nick Smith, said the Trust earned the award, <em>“For their outstanding contribution to improving freshwater management across the country by engaging private land-owners in environmental protection work.”</em> </p> 
<p>Board chair Richard Thompson paid tribute to the Trust’s dedicated staff who focus on delivering the Trust’s vision of ‘sustainable land management through community engagement’. These staff include RWNZ member Barbara Stuart, who works as a Regional Co-ordinator in the top of the South Island. Mr Thompson also acknowledged the passion and hard work of the people in rural communities that the Trust works with.</p> 
<p>Based in Cable Bay, RWNZ member Barbara Stuart is the Regional Co-ordinator responsible for Landcare projects in the Nelson/Marlborough area.&nbsp; We spoke with her about her work, after the Green Ribbon Award win was announced.</p> 
<p>She was full of praise for the support of Rural Women NZ members in her region, especially Rai Valley and Bainham branch members.</p> 
<p>“The Rai Valley Rural Women are absolute Trojans in working on water quality and we’ve had great support from Bainham as well.”</p> 
<p>Barbara says her role is to support private landowners in sustainable land management, working with communities where water quality problems have been shown to exist.</p> 
<p>“Our job is to help our farmers to deal with that.&nbsp; We like our farmers to be the leaders, so they commissioned their own scientific reports and together they all sat around and decided how to deal with it.&nbsp; It’s a bottom up approach, working with land-owners and land care groups to help them to resolve their own industry issues.”</p> 
<p>Barbara sees it as important for farmers to get the right advice, so they spend their dollar once and well.&nbsp; In the Rai Valley, AgResearch, Dairy NZ and Fonterra specialists have provided technical advice to ensure the systems put in place will work in high rainfall areas on valley floors.</p> 
<p>The three key messages being promoted by the Trust are that livestock needs to be kept out of water through fencing systems; there needs to be sufficient effluent storage capacity, with councils pushing for two to three months; and the effluent should be spread on the land at low rates when the soils can take it up, to capture the nutrients, thus saving the farmer money.</p> 
<p>In July the Trust is launching new fact sheets to help maintain and improve water quality in Golden Bay.&nbsp; The fact sheets are tailored to the local area and farmers help to write them.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>“We utilise our farmer skills to lead the projects, and I am really proud to say that when it comes to environmental issues, it is the farming women who ‘get it’,” says Barbara.&nbsp; “They are so receptive.&nbsp; They nurture their land as they nurture their families.&nbsp; They are quick to pick up the concepts of tipping points of production.”&nbsp; </p> 
<p>“This is quite new for farming families.&nbsp; It is something we haven’t had to confront before.&nbsp; You could always buy more land.”</p> 
<p>Barbara and her farmer husband Ian both come from pioneer families with good networks, which is important for her work.</p> 
<p>“I am passionate about working with the rural community to help position them to farm in the third millennium.”&nbsp; </p> 
<p>She points to the pressure to produce food for a planet that is reaching peak population and the coming shortage of fossil fuels and fertilisers.</p> 
<p>“There is a whole new way of thinking and in the past our farmers have been highly innovative and it is about tapping into that innovation in rural communities to make that next step forward.” </p>]]></body>

        <title>Women on boards: what we can learn from Australia 03-Aug-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 03, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand has a thing or two to learn from Australia when it comes to getting women on boards.</p> 
<p>In May, the Minister of Women’s Affairs, Hon Hekia Parata, met some of Australia’s top business leaders to understand how dramatic changes in Australian business culture are driving a surge in the number of women on company boards. </p> 
<p>Under Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) rules introduced last year, companies are required to set measurable targets for the advancement of women into senior management and board roles. Business across the Tasman is responding positively because they see advantages for themselves in having more women in leadership. </p> 
<p>“These changes are largely driven by male business leaders, who are building gender equality into the strategies of their companies,” says Pamela Cohen, Director of the Nominations Service at the Ministry of Women’s Affairs. </p> 
<p>The targets set are often ambitious, with senior managers being offered incentives to achieve them. For example, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia has a target of 35 percent women in senior management roles by 2014 – and to achieve this, 65 percent of appointments over the next three years will need to be women. </p> 
<p>According to Ms Cohen, the key to faster change in Australia is that the business leaders themselves see the advantages – including better productivity and improved business performance – and are pushing the change. There’s a champions group of 12 business leaders – including the CEOs of Qantas, Telstra, IBM and New Zealander Sir Ralph Norris, CEO of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. </p> 
<p>“There is also an effective mentoring programme, which involves 56 of the top chairs in Australia.” </p> 
<p>The NZ Ministry of Women's Affairs is investigating ways of getting greater business involvement in increasing women's leadership here. </p> 
<p>“Helping to establish a champions group is certainly one of the options, because what Australia tells us is that change really takes off when it is business leaders themselves that take the lead.” </p> 
<p>New Zealand women can also promote change as individuals and collectively. They can use their positions as shareholders and employees to ask why the companies with which they are associated are not making full use of women’s skills, and they can join and support organisations that are working for change. </p>]]></body>

        <title>ACWW – Walk the Length of New Zealand</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 03, 2011</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/20110803_walk.jpg" style="border: 0px;"><br> <br> Be part of a world-wide phenomenon and join in our ACWW Women Walk the World challenge!</p> 
<p> Visiting South Pacific Area President, Ruth Shanks, outlined the plan for this event at National Conference 2011.</p> 
<p> She said on ACWW Day, 29th April 2012, members throughout the world are being asked to join in ‘Women Walk the World for ACWW’. The aim of the walk is to raise the image and promote the work of ACWW as well as increase funds through sponsorship of the walkers.</p> 
<p> “The walk could be an organised ramble, a walk around a neighbourhood, a stroll in a park or whatever you like.”</p> 
<p> We are keen to set our own challenge as part of this event, to walk the length of New Zealand!&nbsp; New Zealand is 1600 kilometres long, so if each of our seven regions arranges walks totalling 230 kilometres in length, we will be have walked the entire length of the country.</p> 
<p> This could be a great way to encourage health and fitness and have lots of fun along the way, as well as promoting our organisation and ACWW.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Make sure you let national office know your plans and we’ll help with publicity for your events.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/20110803_triplef.jpg" style="border: 0px;"><br> <br> The third assault of the Central Otago Rail Trail by Rural Women New Zealand at the end of April was an awesome event to have been part of, says organiser Pat Macaulay.</p> 
<p> “All the participants agreed that you could easily add a fourth ‘F’ to the challenge title – ‘Fitness, Fun, Friendship and Fantastic experience!”</p> 
<p> Ninety-two members and friends joined in the three day event, including 28 walkers, 54 bikers and their support crew.&nbsp; Participants came from all parts of the country and as far afield as Australia, including a team of three sisters who took up the challenge for the third time.</p> 
<p> Central Otago turned on perfect weather for the riders and walkers, who received a special welcome to the area by Mayoress Bernie Lepper, and Daphne Hull, chair of the Otago Central Rail Trail Trust.&nbsp; Mayor Tony Lepper also joined the bikers and walkers during their lunch break at Galloway.</p> 
<p> Celebrity chef Jo Seager gave a talk at Omakau about her involvement with Hospice New Zealand, and a charity auction raised approximately $4,000, which will be shared between the Otago and Southland Hospices.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Jo Seager also joined the group on their visit to the International Curling Rink at Naseby for an evening of fun on and off the ice.</p> 
<p> Leaving Ranfurly Railway Station on Sunday morning, Maniototo baritone and high country farmer David McAtamney, sent everyone on their way to Middlemarch with a rousing rendition of “Oh What a Beautiful Morning”.</p> 
<p>Local East-Otago Waikouaiti member, Aileen Winmill, took part with a team of friends from the area.&nbsp;&nbsp; With Aileen’s initiative a further $1,000 was raised for the Otago Hospice as four local businesses sponsored this team.</p>]]></body>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/warehouse2.jpg"><br> <br> Calls for help from the Christchurch Women's Refuge and the Dallington Community Hub in the eastern suburbs have resulted in a great example of teamwork, with The Warehouse donating a supply of warm pyjamas, children’s underwear, bed socks and hot water bottles.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Within a day of making a phone call to The Warehouse, executive officer Noeline Holt had secured a supply of winter woolies from the Wellington branches of the company, which pooled a trolley load of clothing and hotwater bottles valued at more than $600.</p> A call was then made to Allied Pickford Moving Company which generously transported the goods down to Christchurch free of charge. 
<p>Meanwhile Canterbury based Rural Women New Zealand member, Helen Heddell, coordinated a team of volunteers to deliver lamb roasts to the hard hit areas in the suburbs of Christchurch.</p> 
<p>We have many examples of teamwork from all sectors of New Zealand, with outstanding contributions and ideas from our own membership working with their communities in support of Canterbury”, Noeline Holt said.</p>]]></body>

 <br> One year on from the first Canterbury earthquake, Rural Women New Zealand will celebrate ‘Aftersocks Day’ on Friday 2 September to show its support for Cantabrians.
</div> 
<br> “Our

<br> 
<br> Rural Women New Zealand members around the country will be hitting the streets selling 
<a href="http://aftersocks.co.nz">aftersocks™</a>,&nbsp;making sure everyone around the country has a pair to wear.
<br> 
<br> Telecom is also coming on board to show their support for Rural Women New Zealand's project, with its executive team donning their 
<a href="http://aftersocks.co.nz">aftersocks™</a>, and encouraging their staff to buy a pair.
<br>

   In Wellington national office staff visited Telecom offices all over the city, where a&nbsp;looming Father's Day gave a special impetus to sales!

        <title>Time for 20kmh School Bus Signs 06-Sep-2011</title>
        <date>Tuesday, September 06, 2011</date>
        <img>/School bus2.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/School bus2.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 153px; border: 0px solid;"><br> <br> Rural Women New Zealand applauds Transport Minister Steven Joyce’s decision to accept our recommendation and extend the 20kmh speed limit past school buses to 20 seconds before and after a school bus has stopped if the bus is displaying a flashing sign.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>However Rural Women New Zealand now urges the Government to take the next step and approve an active school bus sign that includes the 20kmh speed limit.<br> <br> “Our research shows that many New Zealand drivers, as well as tourists, are unaware of the 20kmh limit and are failing to slow down, making our children very vulnerable, especially on rural roads where there are no footpaths,” says RWNZ health spokesperson, Kerry Maw.<br> <br> Current approved school bus signs include one of children crossing with flashing ‘wig wag’ lights, but there is no approved sign that includes the 20kmh speed limit.<br> <br> Rural Women New Zealand has worked extensively with traffic engineering researchers who have developed an active 20kmh school bus sign, but the sign awaits approval from the NZ Transport Agency.<br> <br> Testing of the prototype sign has shown it to be very effective in slowing drivers. Overseas research also supports the use of clear speed limit signage.<br> <br> Rural communities have begun to raise funds for active 20kmh signs for their local school buses, and keenly await their approval and production.<br> <br> “The number of children killed and injured after getting off school buses has not improved for 30 years, and behind every statistic is a devastated family,” says Mrs Maw. <br> <br> “It is time we focused on every possible solution to ensure our school children are kept safe.” <br> <br> <a href="http://www.ashburtonguardian.co.nz/news/todays-news/5138-urgent-call-for-school-bus-signs.html">Article - Ashburton Guardian 6 September 2011</a></p>

        <title>RWNZ Council asks Hon Tony Ryall the Hard Questions 06-Sep-2011</title>
        <date>Tuesday, September 06, 2011</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Liz Evan_ Tony Ryall.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="font-size: 13px; width: 250px; height: 360px; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Liz Evan_ Tony Ryall.jpg">RWNZ National Council had a trial run of some of their hard questions when the Minister of Health, the Hon Tony Ryall, visited the recent National Council meeting. Contrary to expectation, the Minister did not use time to talk exclusively about party politics. In fact, after the introductions, he sat down at the table and asked us what we wanted to talk about.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>The Council asked him specifically to review the effectiveness of the<span>&nbsp; </span>2007 Fair Travel Policy for home support workers who have to use their<span>&nbsp; </span>vehicles to travel to<span>&nbsp; </span>clients in rural areas with very limited recompense (about 20c per km).<span>&nbsp; </span>Few, if any, other workers in New Zealand are required to self fund travelling between various<span>&nbsp; </span>places of work several times per day.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>Mr Ryall said he would re-evaluate the policy and asked for some specific examples of support workers who have been disadvantaged.<br> <br> He was asked to make home based support services, often the Cinderella area of health funding and status, higher up on the priority list, especially when considering inflation price adjustments.<span>&nbsp; </span>He said he would look at it if re-elected.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Other topics covered<span>&nbsp; </span>during the<span>&nbsp; </span>hour-plus meeting included the need for more support for rural-based midwives, the advances in technology related dementia care, and<span>&nbsp; </span>rural dental health which Mr Ryall said is increasingly becoming a major problem for the over 65’s age group, as well as for&nbsp;rural children.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>The Minister’s future specific targets included shorter waiting times for elective surgery, cancer treatment and emergency department consults; a 90% immunisation rate for 2 year-olds, affordable stop smoking programmes and more focus on cardio vascular disease and diabetes.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>As he left the Rural Women New Zealand office complete with a&nbsp; pair of Corporate Aftersocks, Mr Ryall thanked Rural Women New Zealand&nbsp; “for all that you do”.</p>]]></body>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Resolutions passed included recommendations that groups lobby their governments to provide stricter surveillance of all imported goods and containers, and to ban the importation of primary industry and horticultural products ‘which have the potential to ruin local production’.&nbsp; </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Also carried was the request for closer monitoring and public reporting by government of the use of financial help and ‘in kind’ donations distributed annually or in times of disasters, through each nations’ agencies.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">A New South Wales resolution calling for organizations to lobby their governments to urgently resume World Trade Organisation negotiations for the removal of tariffs and agricultural subsidies which are distorting world food markets, damaging the environment and hindering the development of sustainable agriculture throughout the world was also carried.</span></p>

        <title>Speeds Past School Buses Safety Campaign 23-Sep-2011</title>
        <date>Friday, September 23, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="460" height="264" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/w0Jb9cURTW4" frameborder="0"></iframe> &nbsp;&nbsp;Our campaign for 20kmh flashing signs to be installed on all school buses got valuable airtime this week, as former RWNZ National Councillor, Sue Saunders, was a guest on TVCentral News.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>
 <o:p _rdeditor_exists="1">
  <span lang="EN-US">We say "How many more children will be hurt or killed before we see flashing 20kmh signage become mandatory for all school buses?"</span>
 </o:p> 
 <o:p _rdeditor_exists="1"></o:p></p> 
<o:p _rdeditor_exists="1"> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">In the United States it’s illegal to pass a school bus that’s stopped.&nbsp; The bright yellow buses are lit up like a Christmas tree.&nbsp; </span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">Here our school buses are less obvious.&nbsp; Often multi-purpose, they can be any size, shape or colour, and must simply display a SCHOOL or KURA sign.</span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">An approaching motorist must register that the bus stopped ahead is a school bus, long before they can read the SCHOOL sign.&nbsp; It’s certainly not ‘top of the mind’ when driving on the open road. </span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">Next the driver must remember the Road Code requirement to pass a school bus at 20kmh in either direction, despite that speed limit not being shown anywhere on the bus.</span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">We protect our road workers with 30kmh signs, road cones and high tech traffic controls, yet we drop young and vulnerable children by the side of the open road in rural areas with no speed signs or warning lights and no pavement.</span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">With tragic injury and death statistics, which have not improved for thirty years, Rural Women New Zealand wants to see all school buses fitted with flashing warning lights and 20kmh signs that light up as the bus stops.</span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">Transport Engineering Research New Zealand has recently developed 20kmh signs incorporating flashing lights that can be produced for $500 a sign, or $1,000 per bus.&nbsp; </span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">The $2.5 million to install 20kmh flashing signs on all the country’s 2,500 school buses is less than the ‘social cost’ of $3.5 million the Ministry of Transport puts on just one life lost on the roads.</span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">We suggest some of the $10 million held by the Road Safety Trust from the first time sale of personalized number plates should be spent on equipping all school buses with flashing 20kmh signs without delay.</span></p> 
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US">Our children are worth it.</span></p>

To date we have seen events in the Top of the South, Taranaki/Waikato, Manawatu and North Auckland.</p> 
<p> <br> The Top of the South came together in St Arnaud in very chilly conditions, but the event itself was warm and buzzing as the picture above shows! Participants heard from inspiring leaders John Ayling (chair of Access) and Suzanne Win (former chair of the Nelson/Marlborough DHB), as well as presentations from Liz Evans and Jackie Edkins about RWNZ, and thought-provoking discussions led by Heather Sorensen, Sue Higgins and Michelle Reilly.<br> <br> The Taranaki/Waikato group met in Hamilton and was treated to a visionary presentation by Liz Evans, a morning workout on women’s health by Hillary Saxton and some inspiring presentations by Tineke Verkade, our RWNZ Enterprising Rural Women Award winner 2010, Donna Blackburn from Telecom and Anna Yardley from AgITO.<br> <br> At the Lower North Island event attendees enjoyed a panel discussion on Women in Leadership, a speaking with confidence presentation, and insightful presentations by Liz Evans and Dame Margaret Millard.<br> <br> A highlight of the Top of the North Island event was the enthusiasm of the new members who took part, including three individual members who made plans to form an email group.</p>

        <title>Christchurch Womens Refuge appreciates RWNZ support 30-Sep-2011</title>
        <date>Friday, September 30, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>We have received a warm 'thank you' letter from Christchurch Women's Refuge for all the practical support&nbsp;from Rural Women NZ members around the country.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Donations of clothing, petrol vouchers, hand-knitted items, food and more have been sent&nbsp;by RWNZ&nbsp;groups in Glenorchy, Rakaia, Henley, Mid Canterbury, Mid East Provincial Southland, Motunui Beach, Piako Provincial, Thames Valley, Mangatoro, Tokanui, Otara, Waikawa and Tokarahi.</p> 
<p>Christchurch Women's Refuge says "It is lovely to be taken under the wing of an organisation like [Rural Women New Zealand], which can mobilise many women to support other women and their families at an extremely difficult time.&nbsp; We are very glad to be the conduit through which you have helped so many families."</p> 
<p>Christchurch Women's Refuge says rural calls for support initially increased by 40% and incidents of family violence in North Canterbury have doubled since the February earthquake.&nbsp; They say this is not only because of the increased stress, but the changing demographics of Canterbury as families leave Christchurch city for outlying areas.</p>

        <title>A New car for Rainbow Trust 14-Oct-2011</title>
        <date>Friday, October 14, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Rainbow Place RWNZ car.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Rainbow Place RWNZ car.jpg" style="width: 190px; height: 143px; float: left; margin: 10px; border: 0px solid;"> T<span style="line-height: 21px;">wo cars into three therapists just won’t go!&nbsp;</span> This was the dilemma facing Rainbow Place, an arm of Hospice Waikato that supports children and young people coping with serious illness.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With just one aged vehicle and one newer car, Rainbow Place’s three nurse therapists were struggling to meet the growing demand for counselling services in Waikato and Coromandel, leading to long waits for families, particularly in rural areas.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand heard about Rainbow Place’s difficulties, and decided it was the perfect way to use a generous bequest they had recently received from the estate of long-time Rukuhia branch member, Chica Gilmer. Chica died in August 2009 after a short battle with cancer.</p> 
<p>Janet Williams of Rukuhia branch says, “The rural community and children were the passions in Chica’s life.</p> 
<p> <img alt="" src="/rear.JPG" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: right; margin: 10px; border: 0px solid;">She was an educator and had been the deputy principal at Tauranga Girls College. We decided that a project to continue Chica’s work would be ideal.”</p> 
<p> <br> Jim Wright Nissan in Hamilton came up with a generous deal on a new Nissan Micra, and Rukuhia branch raised the balance of the funds needed, with support from other Rural Women New Zealand groups in the Waikato.<br> &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rainbow Place Manager and Children’s Nurse, Penny Parsons says, “I can’t tell you what it’s going to mean to us. Our case load has increased substantially as people have got to know about Rainbow Place.”</p> 
<p>Rainbow Place therapists travel around 2,500 kilometres a month, mainly to families in remote areas, or those unable to travel to Hamilton.</p> 
<p>“When things are bad for families, lives are complicated enough without having to travel big distances to get support,” she says.</p> 
<p>Rainbow Place’s nurses and therapists support both children who have a serious illness and those who need support for grief and loss due to the illness or death of a family member.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Dynamic Leaders Course - 15-17 February 2012 14-Oct-2011</title>
        <date>Friday, October 14, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Our very successful Wellington Experience programme, which has been running for 10 years, has been re-named ‘Growing Dynamic Leaders’ to better describe what you’ll achieve on this three day course.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><strong>We are now seeking expressions of interest for our February 2012 programme, so if you're keen to be part of this exciting opportunity, here's a sample of what you can expect ....</strong></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">"The Wellington Experience 2010 was a challenging and intensive programme, exploring many aspects of leadership and organization and how they relate to the future of Rural Women New Zealand," Heather Paton, Macraes Dunback branch.<br> "Twelve of us from different Regions all got to know each other and soak up the Experience – action packed! We discussed differing leadership styles and personalities, then had to interview a Mayor, MP, MAF CEO and others with three pre-organised questions then collate the data and decide which leadership style they had from autocratic, democratic to facilitative on a type of sliding scale. This was quite fascinating," Virginia Broughton, Southland Interprovincial.<br> "Guest speaker presentations led up to us working together on a group presentation to Landcorp, who sponsor the Wellington Experience. Over a working dinner and into the evening we honed our earlier brainstorming session into a working presentation focusing on the work that Rural Women New Zealand does; common goals between the organizations; and ways in which we can work closer together towards the bigger picture of ‘strengthening rural communities," Sue Higgins, Top of the South.<br> "It was high powered and intense but most enjoyable and I thank Rural Women NZ for giving me the opportunity for participating in the Master class 2010. A special thanks to Margaret Chapman, Liz Evans and the staff for all your help, fun and encouragement," Melva Robb, Pelorus Sounds branch.<br> </span></p>

This year so far we’ve run events in Thames, Wharepapa South, Taranaki, Hamilton and Marlborough.</p> 
<p>Pam Thomlinson our Top of the South National Councillor says “Our Beef + Lamb demonstration was hosted by the Awatere branch at Ngaire Lawson’s beautiful new home. The chef was Grant Dicker from the restaurant Mint in Nelson. He prepared garlic seared lamb backstrap with beetroot carpaccio, pickled walnuts and rocket. Poached and grilled sirloin of Angus beef with squash, fondant potato and peppercorn foam, ginger parkin with muscovado sauce and five spice icecream. It was wonderful to learn how to let the taste of the food shine through without being overpowered by too many flavours. A lovely lunch that was enhanced with local wines and coffee and sweet nibbles.”</p> 
<h2>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR 2012</h2> 
<p>While we haven’t yet had confirmation from Beef + Lamb that they will provide Ambassador Chefs for the cooking demonstrations, we are seeking expressions of interest for 2012 so that we can advise them ahead of time the areas where you would like to hold the demonstrations.

        <title>‘Chica’ the bright red car 19-Oct-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, October 19, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Penny Parsons of Rainbow Place.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Penny Parsons of Rainbow Place.jpg" style="width: 230px; height: 155px; float: left; margin: 10px; border: 0px solid;">Children expecting a visit from Rainbow Place’s nurses and therapists can now look forward to shorter waiting times, thanks to the gift of a bright red Nissan car to be named ‘Chica’, donated by Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) at the weekend.</p> 
<p>The therapists and nurses at Rainbow Place - an arm of Hospice Waikato - travel thousands of kilometers each month throughout Waipa, Waikato and Coromandel, supporting children and young people who are coping with serious illness or bereavement.</p> 
<p>When members of RWNZ’s Rukuhia branch heard about Rainbow Place’s dire lack of transport, particularly for visiting families in rural areas, they were keen to help.</p> 
<p>“The branch had been asked to distribute a bequest from one of its treasured members and former teacher, Chica Gilmer, and we felt giving a car to Rainbow Place was the perfect way to use that bequest,” says Shirley Read, RWNZ’s National Councillor for the Waikato region.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rukuhia branch members soon raised the rest of the money needed to buy the car, with help from other RWNZ groups in the region, while Jim Wright Nissan came up with a generous deal on a new Nissan Micra.</p> 
<p>Shirley Read says “It’s great to see what a small number of people can do when they all work together, and to have Chica’s name remembered in this way.”</p> 
<p>On Saturday the handover day arrived, and 30 RWNZ members, MPs and the deputy mayor gathered at Rainbow Place for a key presentation ceremony.</p> 
<p>“As we waited in the car park, the excitement and anticipation was palpable,” says Rainbow Place Manager, Penny Parsons.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“The Rainbow Place team are so grateful to Rural Women New Zealand members. We just want to say a huge thank you, not only on behalf of the staff, but also on behalf of the children, young people and their families who we now visit, and those we will be visiting in the future. It is the support of our local community that enables us to carry on doing our work with children and families going through ‘tough stuff’.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ congratulates Tori Van Straalen of Otorohanga, the winner of an iPad donated by Jim Wright, for correctly guessing the number of rainbow-coloured balloons that filled the car before the official handover to Rainbow Place.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women NZ would like to congratulate Vodafone on their latest move. Vodafone are inviting small rural communities, in the 2% of New Zealand not covered by Vodafone’s network and outside the scope of the Rural Broadband Initiative, to apply for improved mobile coverage in their local area.</p> 
<p>During the last 6 months Vodafone have been approached by several communities throughout New Zealand who currently have limited or no access to the mobile network, and who fall outside the Rural Broadband Initiative. These communities are keen to improve their communications access, and have requested cellsites to be built in their area.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>What are the application criteria?</h2> 
<p>Communities with no existing mobile coverage who wish to benefit from this scheme must be able to demonstrate as many of the following criteria as possible to qualify for consideration:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Proximity to existing mains power supply&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Letter of support from local MP(s)&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Supporting petition of signed residents who desire the service and their assistance to obtain RMA consent&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>The location must be able to provide line of site options for microwave linking (Vodafone will need to determine this)&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>A willing landowner&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Community willing to provide track maintenance&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>4WD vehicle access&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Support of local iwi including contact person name and number&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Support of local Council or Community Board member/s&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Description of the positive impact the site will bring to the community&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<h2>When and how does Vodafone make these decisions?</h2> 
<div>
 Vodafone will ask for applications between 15th October and 15th December, a selection will be made by 15th January 2012 and the resulting cell sites will be built within the following 12 months.&nbsp;
 <br> 
 <br> 
</div> Decisions will be based on the community’s ability to meet the required criteria and the positive impact the site will have on the local community, as assessed by Vodafone’s community cellsite project team. 
<h2>Contact Vodafone</h2>

        <title>Girls Grow: a Vital Force in Rural Economies 25-Oct-2011</title>
        <date>Tuesday, October 25, 2011</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/GirlsGrow_ReporCover.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 19px;"><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/GirlsGrow_ReporCover.jpg" style="width: 152px; height: 197px; float: left; margin: 10px;"></span>Girls can drive economic growth and social stability; New Chicago Council report calls for increased investment in rural adolescent girls.&nbsp;<br> Adolescent girls living in rural areas of the developing world have untapped potential to drive economic development and help meet the world’s future food supply needs, says a new report released by The Chicago Council on Global Affairs. <a href="http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/UserFiles/File/GlobalAgDevelopment/Report/GirlsGrowReportFinal_v9.pdf">Girls Grow: A Vital Force in Rural Economies</a> identifies opportunities to empower rural girls to spur economic and social change in their families and communities. Catherine Bertini, 2003 World Food Prize Laureate, serves as the publication’s lead author and chair of the project that produced the report. </p> 
<br> Adolescent girls must be a key part of successful agricultural and rural economic development strategies, as they are many of the world’s future farmers, rural leaders, decision makers, and mothers. Rural adolescent girls face a triple challenge due to their location, gender, and age. 
<br> 
<br> The report calls on national governments and bilateral donors to provide services and opportunities that both improve girls’ lives and equip them to be successful economic contributors. Recommended actions include ensuring girls complete secondary school, increasing access to vocational training, eliminating barriers girls face in the work place, building girls’ capacity as decision makers, enhancing health services information and delivery to girls in rural areas, and keeping girls safe. 
<br> 
<br> Special attention is paid to how girls uniquely contribute to agriculture. Women in the developing world make up 43 percent of the agricultural labor force. Girls help with these responsibilities and handle, with their mothers, virtually all domestic chores, including fetching water and carrying firewood.
<br> 
<br> The report recommends that adolescent girls be incorporated into country-wide agricultural development plans, have more opportunities to receive agricultural skill building and participate in rural peer groups, and have greater access to agricultural inputs and credit. Donors are also encouraged to dedicate climate change adaptation and mitigation monies targeting natural resource management to programs including girls. 
<br> 
<br> “If the world is to meet the challenge of feeding 9 billion people by 2050, we must invest in the human capital of those with the potential to transform agricultural economies – adolescent girls,” said Bertini. “Already, they carry much of families’ burdens; with opportunity, they can be major change agents for rural communities and nations. As nations are rediscovering the importance of agricultural development, we want to ensure that the new definition of rural economies’ strengths includes the critical role of adolescent girls.”
<br> 
<br> The report’s conclusions and recommendations were developed through consultations with an advisory group of noted leaders and experts in agriculture, gender, demography, business, and development from government, academia, the private sector, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. 
<br> 
<br> The developing world’s 283 million rural adolescent girls face unique challenges. Many live in poverty, are involved in agriculture, carry heavy work burdens, have limited access to health services, don’t complete school, and marry early. However, it is proven that strengthening women brings benefits to families, economies, and societies. 
<br> 
<br> If women in agriculture were given the same access to productive assets as men, national agricultural output would increase by 2.5-4 percent and poverty would be reduced by 12-17 percent. Interventions during adolescence can often change the trajectory of a girl’s life. In spite of this, less than two cents of every development dollar goes to adolescent girls. 
<br> "Now is the time invest in rural adolescent girls,” says Marshall M. Bouton, president, The Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “The international community is renewing its commitments to agricultural development, and increasingly women, who make up almost half of the world’s agricultural workers, are benefiting. This study finds, however, that progress will only be sustainable if investments are also made in the world’s future farmers, entrepreneurs, and managers – rural adolescent girls.”

Members of the Rai Valley/Pelorus farming community have been working with the NZ Landcare Trust to produce a set of practical steps for maintaining and improving water quality in the high rainfall conditions experienced in the Rai-Pelorus Catchments.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>It highlights four key points:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li> <p>keep stock out of waterways</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>adequate effluent storage capacity</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>low rate effluent application</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>attention to nutrient management&nbsp;</p> <p>Each aspect is clearly illustrated in this poster format document, offering a punchy practical guide to assist making changes on the ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>Farmer Brent Morrison opened the event by saying, “ farmers love their land and the rivers in the area. Most farmers have already completed works on bridges and culverts which are expensive and this has brought about significant improvement in water quality at the Rai Falls."</p> <p><a href="http://www.landcare.org.nz/user-content/3688-rai-factsheet_a4.pdf">Download the full Fact Sheet here.</a></p> </li>

        <title>RWNZ Journalism Award 26-Oct-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, October 26, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago we set up this Award through the<a href="http://www.guildag.co.nz/"> NZ Guild of Agricultural Journalists</a>, to encourage more media coverage about women’s activities and achievements, particularly in the rural media. The strategy is paying off, and this year our Award attracted more entries than any other category (apart from the Guild’s major ‘Rongo’ Award). A great result!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>We are delighted to let you know that NZX Agri journalist Rebecca Harper is our winner this year, for two articles she wrote in Young Country magazine. Her first piece was a story about Erin Reed who took out the Good Keen Girl Competition at the National Fieldays, and the second piece was a story about the inspirational former equestrian Catriona Williams, founder of the Catwalk Trust. To the left is see a picture of Rebecca receiving her certificate and RWNZ cap! Rebecca says: “RWNZ makes a vital contribution to rural communities, there are some fantastic stories out there of women doing inspirational things. It is an honour to receive this award and I hope to continue to share the stories of rural women with the rest of New Zealand.”</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Jon Morgan (incoming President of the Guild and Dominion Post journalist) was our runner up (the third time he has been one of our winners). He says: “Rural Women’s sponsorship is much appreciated by the Guild. I’m sure there has been a sharp rise in the number of women’s stories in farming pages and papers over the past three years.”</p>]]></body>

        <title>New report supports RWNZ call for 20kmh flashing signs for school buses 10-Nov-2011</title>
        <date>Thursday, November 10, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women New Zealand’s push for 20kmh flashing signs to be fitted to all school buses got a boost last week with the release by the New Zealand Transport Agency of <a href="/_literature_67579/TERNZ_flashing_bus_sign_report_2011">new research </a>that shows encouraging driver reaction to the signs.</p> 
<p>“The report on the trial is exciting because it shows that, as we had expected, the flashing 20kmh signs have a significant effect on reducing traffic speed around school buses,” says Rural Women New Zealand’s National President, Liz Evans. "Now we'd like to see these signs approved by NZTA so we can get them on all school buses."</p> 
<p>She says rural children are particularly vulnerable when drivers fail to slow down, with 23 children killed in the last 23 years crossing the road to or from school buses.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"These brightly-lit 20kmh signs are vital to increase the visibility of school buses and remind drivers of the speed limit when passing.”</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand held a stakeholder forum in Wellington last Friday, when Transport Engineering Research New Zealand (TERNZ) presented the results of its 20kmh school bus signage research and distributed its <a href="/_literature_67579/TERNZ_flashing_bus_sign_report_2011">report</a>.</p> 
<p>There was wide-ranging support at the forum for TERNZ’s recommendation that, as a first step, 50 buses in one area should be fitted with illuminated 20kmh signs, alongside a publicity campaign to raise driver awareness.</p> 
<p>In the long run members of the forum called for 20kmh active signs to be fitted to all school buses.</p> 
<p>Lisa Collins, whose son Grant was killed off a school bus in Kaitaia in 2008, attended the Wellington forum.</p> 
<p>She says, “Being part of the forum was wonderful and inspirational, as I can see that so many people share the same passion.</p> 
<p>“I am so happy to be able to share the tragic loss of Grant, to raise awareness and ultimately support change that will in some way help prevent our young children and their families going through the same painful journey that we will always live with. For one moment Grant forgot to think, and that moment cost him his life.”</p> 
<p>Representatives of Government agencies, injury prevention and child safety organisations provided further valuable input to the forum.</p> 
<p>The signs recommended by TERNZ would cost $422 each, plus installation costs, and would be mounted on the front and rear of the bus.</p> 
<p>There are approximately 2,500 school buses operating on 1700 school bus routes around the country.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand suggests that the cost of the signs could come from the Road Safety Trust, which has around $6 million in reserves for community-based road safety projects.</p> 
<p>The release of the TERNZ <a href="/_literature_67579/TERNZ_flashing_bus_sign_report_2011">report</a> follows an accident when a pupil was struck by a school bus in Kaitaia last week, and a rear end crash between a logging truck and a school bus in Ruatoki in September, when 36 children were injured.</p>

        <title>The Referendum: Choose Your Voting System 11-Nov-2011</title>
        <date>Friday, November 11, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p class="bodytext"><span></span>&nbsp;Next year’s referendum gives you the chance to have your say on the voting system you'd like to use to elect our Parliaments in the future.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>You will be asked two questions:</span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
 <li> <p>whether you want to keep MMP (which is the voting system we use at the moment) or whether you want to change to another voting system; and</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>which of four other voting systems you would choose if NZ decides to change from MMP.</p> <p><span><em>Article from<a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/publications/index.html#bulletinaotearoa">&nbsp;Bulletin Aotearoa</a>&nbsp;- November Issue.</em></span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><a name="_Toc308176302" style="color: #01aaa3; font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px; text-transform: uppercase;"><span>Voting Systems on Offer</span></a></p> </li> 
</ul> All these system have 120 Members of Parliament - but the number of electorates in each system can differ. Read on… 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><strong><span>MMP – Mixed Member Proportional</span></strong><span>: In this (NZ’s current system) there 70 electorates, (both Maori and General). Each electorate elects one MP, called an Electorate MP. The other 50 MPs are elected from political party lists and are called List MPs. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>Each voter gets two votes. The first vote (the party vote) is for the political party the voter chooses and largely decides the total number of seats each political party gets in Parliament. The second vote (the electorate vote) is to choose the MP the voter wants to represent the electorate they live in. The candidate who gets the most votes wins. They do not have to get more than half the votes. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>Currently, a political party that wins at least one electorate seat or 5% of the party vote gets a share of the seats in Parliament that is about the same as its share of the party vote (if a party gets 30% of the party vote it will get roughly 36 MPs in Parliament, and if it wins 20 electorate seats it will have 16 List MPs as well as its 20 Electorate MPs).</span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>Coalitions or agreements between political parties are usually needed before Governments can be formed. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><strong><span>FPP - First Past the Post</span></strong><span>: in this there are</span><span> 120 electorates, including the Maori electorates, and each elects one MP. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>Each voter has one vote to choose the MP they want to represent the electorate they live in. The candidate who gets the most votes wins. They do not have to get more than half the votes. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>The winning party usually wins a share of the seats in Parliament larger than its share of all the votes across the country. Smaller parties usually receive a smaller share of seats than their share of all the votes.</span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>A government can usually be formed without the need for coalitions or agreements between parties.</span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><strong><span>PV - Preferential Voting</span></strong><span>: there are<strong> </strong></span><span>120 electorates, including the Maori electorates, elects one MP. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>Each voter ranks the candidates – 1, 2, 3, etc – in the order they prefer them. A candidate who gets more than half of all the first preference “1” votes wins. If no candidate gets more than half the first preference votes, the candidate with the fewest “1” votes is eliminated and their votes go to the candidates each voter ranked next. This continues until one candidate has more than half the votes. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>The winning party usually wins a share of the seats in Parliament larger than its share of all the votes across the country. It is hard for smaller parties to win seats in Parliament, but votes for smaller party candidates may influence who wins the seat because of second, third, etc preferences. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>A government can usually be formed without the need for coalitions or agreements between parties. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><strong><span>STV - Single Transferable Vote</span></strong><span>: in this system each electorate (including the Maori electorates) has more than one MP. It is likely the 120 MPs would be divided between 24 and 30 electorates, each with 3 to 7 MPs. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>Each voter has a single vote that is transferable. Voters rank the candidates (1, 2, 3, etc) in the order they prefer, OR they can vote for the order published in advance by the political party of their choice. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>MPs are elected by receiving a minimum number of votes, known as the quota. This is based on the number of votes in each electorate and the number of MPs to be elected. Candidates who reach the quota from first preference votes are elected. If there are still electorate seats to fill, firstly the votes the elected candidates received beyond the quota are transferred to the candidates ranked next on those votes. Candidates who then reach the quota are elected. Then, if there are still electorate seats to fill, the lowest polling candidate is eliminated and their votes are transferred to the candidates ranked next on those votes. These steps are repeated until all the seats are filled.</span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>The number of MPs elected from each political party usually mirrors the party’s share of all the votes across the country.</span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>Coalitions or agreements between political parties are usually needed before governments can be formed. </span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><strong><span>SM - Supplementary Member</span></strong><span>: t</span><span>here are 90 electorates in this one (including the Maori electorates). Each elects one MP, called an Electorate MP. The other 30 seats are called supplementary seats. MPs are elected to these seats from political party lists and are likely to be called List MPs.</span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><span>Each voter gets two votes. The first vote is to choose the MP the voter wants to represent the electorate they live in. This is called the electorate vote. The candidate who gets the most votes wins. They do not have to get more than half the votes. The second vote is for the political party the voter chooses. This is called the party vote. The share of the 30 supplementary seats each party gets reflects its share of the party vote (if a party gets 30% of the party vote, it will get about 9 List MPs in Parliament, no matter how many electorate seats it wins). This makes SM different from MMP where a party’s share of all 120 seats mirrors its share of the party vote. </span></p> 
<p> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial; color: #333333;">One or other of the major parties would usually have enough seats to govern alone, but coalitions or agreements between parties may sometimes be needed.</span><br> <br> </p>

        <title>Entries now open for the Enterprising Rural Women Award 2012 14-Nov-2011</title>
        <date>Monday, November 14, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Lisa_Harper_1279.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Lisa_Harper_1279.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 301px; float: left; margin: 10px; border: 0px solid;">Winning the Supreme Award in the RWNZ Enterprising Rural Women Award 2011 gave Marlborough cheese maker extraordinaire, Lisa Harper, a real confidence boost, and she would strongly recommend rural businesswomen enter the upcoming 2012 Awards.</p> 
<p>Entries are now open for the Enterprising Rural Women Award 2012, which is a great opportunity for women to raise their business and media profiles and promote their products and services.</p> 
<p>“We know that women face extra hurdles operating a business from a rural location, but we also know that they are incredibly resourceful, especially using social media and technology to make distance less of barrier, and we want to celebrate that success,” says Liz Evans, Rural Women New Zealand’s National President.</p> 
<p>“That’s one reason we’ve introduced a new award category this year, the Fly Buys Online Business Award, for women who are largely carrying out their business via the internet.”</p> 
<p>The 2012 Enterprising Rural Women Awards will also include a Telecom North Island business award and an Access Homehealth South Island business award.</p> 
<p>A Supreme winner will be chosen from the three category winners, and announced on 21 May 2012 at the Rural Women New Zealand National Conference, to be held in Hawera, Taranaki.</p> 
<p>Winner of the 2011 North Island award, Maria-Fe Rohrlach, of merino baby products company Nestling Limited, says the business she runs with her sister, Bernadine Guilleux, has had a real boost as a result of their win this year. She also recommends women enter the 2012 Awards.</p> 
<p>“Entering the RWNZ Enterprising Rural Women Award 2011 has given us more momentum in the marketplace, both in New Zealand and overseas. As a direct result we have had sales opportunities and doors open in Germany and the Netherlands.</p> 
<p>“Overall it has been a period of personal and professional growth since winning and we would highly recommend all rural women in business apply. It is worth it!”</p> 
<p>Entries for the Enterprising Rural Women Award close Friday 16 March 2012. <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/post/Enterprising_Rural_Women_Award_2012/">For entry details click here.</a></p>

        <title>Rural Women NZ says time to bring back Minister of Rural Affairs 14-Nov-2011</title>
        <date>Monday, November 14, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women New Zealand welcomes news that the re-appointment of a Minister of Rural Affairs is back on the political agenda.</p> 
<p>The position was axed three years ago, leaving many rural people without a direct voice in Parliament.</p> 
<p>“Only 14% of the population who identify themselves as rural actually work in agriculture,” says Rural Women New Zealand National President, Liz Evans.</p> 
<p>“We don’t believe the interests of the other 86% of the rural population can be realistically and effectively represented by a Minister of Agriculture and Biosecurity, who already has a huge and specific workload.</p> 
<p>“We were assured three years ago that rural community interests would be addressed by other Ministries, but often rural concerns seem to be marginalised and wait listed. As a result, Rural Women New Zealand still sees the need for the reinstatement of a Minister of Rural Affairs.”</p> 
<p>Our brief to the Minister would be to safeguard the wider rural perspective in all legislation and to champion rural issues to the whole of government by encouraging rural impact assessments on all legislation and policy.</p>

<p>Their flock is unique in New Zealand in that they have developed a polled strain from within their own flock. While not all their Drysdale’s are yet polled (selection for the best fleeces is the priority), a high proportion of the flock is. The number of flocks has decreased in New Zealand although demand for their wool is still high. The lambs that we saw were very nuggety and meaty and Craig says surplus lambs kill out very well.</p> 
<p>While there they also took the opportunity to look around Janet’s lovely late spring garden. A great day had by all.</p>

        <title>Consultation on Agriculture Sector Action Plan 14-Dec-2011</title>
        <date>Wednesday, December 14, 2011</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Improving health and safety in the agriculture industry – a sector with one of the highest death and injury tolls - is the focus of the draft<a href="http://www.dol.govt.nz/consultation/agriculture-sector-plan/"> Agriculture Section Action Plan&nbsp;released for consultation today</a>(14/12/2011).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The draft Agriculture Sector Action Plan is part of the Government’s National Action Agenda to reduce the work toll in the five sectors where the most harm is occurring; construction, forestry, agriculture, manufacturing and fishing.</p> 
<p>Sector Action Plans are being developed by the Department of Labour in partnership with key stakeholders in each sector. To date Action Plans have been released for the construction and forestry sectors.</p> 
<p>The agriculture sector has one of the highest rates of work-related injury and fatalities in New Zealand. According to ACC data between 2005 and 2010 at least 50% of all injuries and nearly 60% of deaths in agriculture were related to:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li> <p>the use of agricultural vehicles and machinery&nbsp;</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>the physical and mental health/wellbeing of agricultural workers&nbsp;</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>slips, trips and falls, and&nbsp;</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>animal handling.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>This draft Action Plan focuses on these four areas – with 20 specific actions for government, industry, employers and sector and worker organisations to improve health and safety.</p> 
<p>More than 30 organisations, including Rural Women New Zealand have been extensively involved in developing the draft Action Plan – together with the Department we all have a role to play in reducing the high death and injury rate in agriculture.</p>

        <title>A Fresh Look at Poplars and Willows - Trees on Farms workshop for 2012 16-Dec-2011</title>
        <date>Friday, December 16, 2011</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Poplar.JPG</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Poplar.JPG" style="width: 200px; height: 133px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px solid;">Poplars and willows - they’re the arboreal workhorse of our rural landscape, holding hillsides and river banks together, providing shade, shelter, timber and fodder for stock when feed is short.&nbsp;It’s therefore appropriate that the first Trees on Farms workshop for 2012, to be held in Central Hawke’s Bay in February, will focus on the management of these two species at a time of year when the option of harvesting appropriate trees for fodder starts to look very appealing.</p> 
<p><strong>The workshop will be held in the Huatokitoki catchment south east of Waipukurau on Wednesday February 15, starting at 9a.m.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>President of the Hawke’s Bay Farm Forestry Association Ed Saathof says a growing number of local farmers want to find out more about poplar and willow management, especially safe ways of feeding out and how to manage poplars and willows when they get bigger.</p> 
<p>The morning session will therefore run through the basics of poplar and willow management, and include presentations on new clones and the benefits of shade and shelter on stock productivity.</p> 
<p>Keith Betteridge, a senior scientist at AgResearch Grasslands, Palmerston North, will present a case study on the impact of shade on animal productivity based on trials at a hill country farm near Porangahau. Welfare and the environmental consequences of providing shade will also be discussed.</p> 
<p>In the Porangahau trials Angus cows were exposed to one of two treatments - space-planted shade trees, or no trees. Pasture was unlimited and the stocking rate was 2.1 cows+calves/ha. GPS collars identified where the cows were throughout the three week trial, while motion sensors on their leg showed whether they were standing, walking, grazing or lying down.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Amongst many findings, the point of most interest was that cows with shade grazed 30-40 minutes longer each day compared to cows without shade,” says Keith Betteridge. “This contradicted the opinions of those who assumed that if cows were under shade, they would not be eating and therefore not growing. Shade trees provided a place for cows that was 10 degrees cooler than out in the open, which, for these black cows that experienced up to 50 degrees C on their back, proved to be most welcome. These cows used shade extensively from around 9 a.m. until mid afternoon.”</p> 
<p>Video clips of successful farm foresters from the Hawke’s Bay Farm Forestry Association will provide case studies of local on-farm success with trees.</p> 
<p>The morning session will also include a presentation by AgFirst on the economic impact of building trees into an integrated land management strategy, including use of Farmax modelling, and the role of tree planting in generating diverse revenue streams - spreading risk and cash flow, enabling short-term and inter-generational/succession planning.</p> 
<p>After lunch a farm tour will look at specific management issues in the field, including demonstrations of managing trees for fodder, and the merits of appropriate commercial production species and native plantings for Hawke’s Bay.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As well as written information and hard copies of presentations, workshop participants will receive a CD containing the workshop presentations, interviews with local farm foresters, recent poplar and willow publications and electronic handbooks outlining best practice growing and management of the major farm forestry timber species.</p> 
<p>The workshop is free to attend, but an indication of numbers is needed for catering purposes.<strong> For more information contact Ian Nicholas at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d7bef9b9beb4bfb8bbb6a497b4bbb2b6a5f9b9b2a3f9b9ad">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> (07 348 5923, 0274 505 904) or Hawke’s Bay NZFFA secretary Marie Taylor plantHawke’<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e99a8b8890a9919d9b88c78a86c78793">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> (06 836 7018, 0274 424 536)</strong></p> 
<p><strong><br> </strong>Trees on Farms is being funded by MAF’s Sustainable Farming Fund, and the NZ Farm Forestry Association, Tane’s Tree Trust, Agfirst, and regional and unitary councils. Targeted at farmers and other land managers, these workshops aim to highlight tree planting options that will help farm profit, succession planning, and social and environmental sustainability in the long term. Following the highly successful inaugural workshop held in Gisborne in November, a further 25 workshops and hui will be held around New Zealand in 2012-13.</p>]]></body>

        <body><![CDATA[<p>Glenorchy Rural Women&nbsp;recently&nbsp; had their Christmas function at <a href="http://www.punatapu.com/">Punatapu</a>. &nbsp; <img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Glenorchy_Punatapu 2011_eating.JPG" style="width: 151px; height: 226px; float: left; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Glenorchy_Punatapu 2011_House.JPG" style="width: 151px; height: 226px; float: left; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"></p> 
<p><a href="http://www.punatapu.com/">Punatapu </a>was established by Dr Pat Farry and his wife Sue; Pat was a GP in Queenstown for many years and was a passionate advocate of rural health and rural general practice, travelling the world to teach and learn about delivering health&nbsp;services&nbsp;in rural areas, and he died suddenly and unexpectedly a couple of years ago.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sue has established a Trust, the <a href="http://www.patfarrytrust.co.nz/">Pat Farry Rural Health Education Trust</a>, and so Rural Women group members donated to the trust and we had a delicious lunch cooked by Debbie Crompton, one of our Rural Women members, who is a well-known local chef. It was &nbsp;Debbie's brilliant idea, and it ticked all the boxes for us, a great day out, fabulous setting, contributing to a rural health trust and wonderful food. Plus they have an amazing art collection and we were lucky enough to have Marilyn Webb the artist with us on the day to talk to us about what we were looking at and her own art and life, so the whole day was really awesome. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>A great day had by all!</p>

        <title>Neighbours Day Aotearoa 2012 04-Jan-2012</title>
        <date>Wednesday, January 04, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Neighbours Day Aotearoa Logo.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Neighbours Day Aotearoa Logo.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 174px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px solid;">What is Neighbours Day Aotearoa?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Neighbours Day Aotearoa is about turning New Zealand streets and roads into neighbourhoods.</p> 
<p>That means encouraging all of us in New Zealand to go one step further in getting to know our neighbours on the 24-25 March 2012. Whether it's a first wave or smile, a chat over the fence, inviting someone in for a cuppa or holding a community barbeque, every connection makes our neighbourhoods more friendly, fun and safe.</p> 
<p>Neighbours Day Aotearoa is also about celebrating the neighbourhoods we have. It's not about big events, but local activity in every street and neighbourhood. Neighbours Day Aotearoa is something for ALL New Zealanders to be involved in.</p> 
<h3>The Rural Women NZ Challenge!</h3> 
<p>We would like to encourage our members around New Zealand to support&nbsp;Neighbours Day Aotearoa on the 24-25 March 2012. A great way to get to know others in your community and even&nbsp;recruit&nbsp;some new RWNZ members!</p> 
<p><strong>There are many ways you could celebrate Neighbours Day Aotearoa... Here are a few ideas!&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Before Neighbours Day, pop a note card into your neighbours’ letterboxes, asking if they’re interested in getting to know one another and take it from there (You can download a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.neighboursday.org.nz/dox/NDA2012-NeighboursPack(2).pdf">10-step guide to planning a street get-together&nbsp;here!</a>)</li> 
 <li>Say kia ora, hello, talofa, mālō ē lelei, ni hao or whatever works for you and your neighbours!</li> 
 <li>Organise a street BBQ, or a morning/afternoon tea – ask your neighbours to bring along food to share (or, how about making a giant batch of pancakes and having breakfast together?)&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Host an international pot luck (shared) meal with a few of your neighbours - invite everyone to bring a dish in their local tradition</li> 
 <li>Bake something to give to your neighbours or invite them over to your home for a cup of tea</li> 
 <li>Next time you mow your grass verge why not do your neighbours’ verge as well?&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Exchange phone numbers in case of emergencies – help your neighbours by giving them all a copy of each other’s contacts (with their permission)</li> 
 <li>Share home-grown produce with your neighbours or start a local community garden</li> 
 <li>Get online: set up a Facebook page or website for your street or neighbourhood to help you organise neighbourly activities&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Organise a sports / games afternoon – egg and spoon, sack, relay races, chalk-drawing competitions are simple and great fun&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Get creative with your neighbours and decorate your letter-boxes together</li> 
 <li>Organise a street clean-up, gardening / working bee, or giant garage-sale</li> 
 <li>Find out who plays what instrument in your street and organise a musical jam session</li> 
 <li>Do a street clothes swap: Recycle clothes and refresh your family’s wardrobes!</li> 
 <li>Start a neighbourhood library for things you and your neighbours are happy to lend / share with each other (e.g. ladders, tools, books, toys, sports gear, music, art &amp; craft supplies...)</li> 
</ul>

        <title>QSM awarded to Rural stars! 04-Jan-2012</title>
        <date>Wednesday, January 04, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/QMS.JPG</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/QMS.JPG" style="width: 150px; height: 114px; float: left; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border: 0px solid;">Neil and Hazel MacMillan are a double act, juggling dozens of volunteer roles with running a Far North farm so it's fitting that they've pulled off a rare double by both receiving a Queen's Service Medal for services to the community.</p> 
<p>Both have been deeply involved with farming and community causes for more than 30 years, first from their dairy farm on Puketotara Rd, west of Kerikeri, and for the past nine years from their 280ha sheep and beef farm in the picturesque Utakura Valley west of Okaihau.</p> 
<p>Mrs MacMillan has&nbsp;previously&nbsp;held leading roles in Rural Women New Zealand and was a founding member of the Life Education Trust in the Far North and the local Civil Defence committee.</p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Mr MacMillan, whose five years in the army included one in Vietnam, has been instrumental in the Kaikohe and Districts RSA, serving as vice-president and president for 14 years, and has organised Okaihau's Anzac Day service for the past 20 years.</span>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Much of their community work is done together, or one will look after the farm to free the other up for volunteering.</p> 
<p>Both are active members of the Okaihau Lions Club and encourage young farmers through the Farm Cadet Scheme and by hosting agricultural exchange students.</p> 
<p>Since 2006 Mr MacMillan has been chairman of the Northland Regional Animal Health Committee, while Mrs MacMillan is the organisation's secretary and minute-taker. Right now they are organising a Vietnam vets' reunion at Waitangi in June.</p> 
<p>A full list of the causes and organisations they have been involved with would fill up much of this page.</p> 
<p>Mr MacMillan was raised in Broadwood, North Hokianga, meeting his English-born wife-to-be via the Waikato Tramping Club when both were living in Hamilton.</p>

<p>They have three children, twins Nancy and Jenny, 32, and David, 29.</p> 
<p>Mrs MacMillan said she had been influenced by the uncle and aunt who brought her up in England.</p> 
<p>"They did a huge amount of work for other people without reward. I really enjoy it. You meet people with huge generosity of spirit, you have fun, and why not?" she said.</p>

        <title>Driving Practice Will Help Rural Kids To Survive 04-Jan-2012</title>
        <date>Wednesday, January 04, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>“Too many rural teenagers are killed and injured in road crashes when they start to drive by themselves on their restricted licence, and we need to do something about it” says ACC’s General Manager Insurance and Prevention Services, Keith McLea. At the same time he understands that rural parents want their teenagers to gain their driving independence as early as possible.</p> 
<p>ACC strongly supports the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) plan to introduce a tougher Restricted Licence practical driving test from February 2012, to reinforce the need for 120 hours of practice in a range of conditions and situations. To support this, ACC and the NZTA are encouraging teen learner drivers and their parents to register with Practice.</p> 
<p>Practice (<a href="https://www.practice.co.nz/">www.practice.co.nz</a>) is a free online programme that helps young drivers develop the skills they need to pass the practical driving test and gain their Restricted Licence. Using the programme will help them become competent drivers, and prepare them for the requirements of the new licence test.</p> 
<p>Overseas research shows that if a learner driver has done 120 hours of supervised driving, their chances of being injured in a crash once they start driving alone is 40% lower than if they had completed around only 50 hours.</p> 
<p>Because they help with farm work, many rural kids get behind the wheel before they are old enough to drive on the roads. However, Dr McLea is reminding parents that although these teenagers might feel confident driving around the farm, they don’t necessarily have the skills to drive safely on the road in all conditions, or drive safely in town too.</p> 
<p>“Driving in the country is good for learning to drive in some challenging conditions, such as on narrow, winding roads, and in loose gravel. But learner drivers also need lots of practice in city situations too. They need to learn to drive in heavy traffic, how to stop and start at busy city traffic lights, what is a safe following distance, and applying the give way rules,” he says.</p> 
<p>The safest way for teenagers to learn all these skills is with an experienced driver sitting right beside them. That experienced driver teaching them to drive is usually the teen’s parent. The Practice programme is designed to help make it easier for parents to teach and learners to learn.</p> 
<p>“Investing a bit of extra time when they are learning is a smart thing to do. It helps keep them safe, and helps them achieve their independence sooner; allowing parents more time to get on with the job of running a busy farm,” he says.</p> 
<p>When a young driver passes their theory test and gains their Learner Licence, they will be sent a brochure about joining Practice. Once they have signed up, and enlisted the help of a ‘Guide’ – usually a parent, relative or experienced friend – to teach them to drive, they can access a raft&nbsp;of information, tips and videos on the Practice website.</p>

        <title>Seeking public help to find paper wasps 19-Jan-2012</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/post/Seeking_public_help_to_find_paper_wasps/"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/paper wasps 2.jpg" style="width: 104px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px solid;"></a><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/post/Seeking_public_help_to_find_paper_wasps/"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Paper wasps.jpg" style="width: 121px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px solid;"></a> There are two species of introduced paper wasps (Polistes wasps) and they were last surveyed in the early 1990s. The first species to become established in New Zealand was the Australian paper wasp Polistes humilis, which has been present here since the 1880s but restricted to the North Island. The second species is the Asian paper wasp Polistes chinensis, which was first recorded in New Zealand in 1979. </p> 
<br> Researcher Darren Ward wants to know if the wasps are continuing to spread through New Zealand, or whether they have reached their ‘limits’.
<br> 
<br> “Paper wasps are a threat to natural ecosystems because they prey on invertebrates, predominantly caterpillars, and also collect nectar in late summer/autumn. Densities of more than 200 nests and 6300 wasps per ha have been recorded in the far north of the North Island.”
<br> 
<br> Specific information Dr Ward requires is:
<br> 
<br> 
<ol> 
 <li>localities from around New Zealand (such as city/town, suburb, street, date, where found)</li> 
 <li>what species is it (Asian or Australian). If you are unsure, a photo is best, even a low resolution image is ok, as the species have very different colours/markings on their body.</li> 
</ol>

        <title>RWNZ calls for national police campaign targeting driving around school buses 10-Feb-2012</title>
        <date>Friday, February 10, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women New Zealand applauds a new campaign by Southern District police to enforce the 20kmh speed limit past a school bus that has stopped to let children on or off, and is calling for the campaign to be rolled out nationally.</p> 
<p>As part of its ‘Back to Schools’ road policing programme, Southern District police have expanded their focus beyond the school gate to also target driving speeds past school buses.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“For the first two weeks of each term, Southern District police will follow school buses along their routes to enforce the 20km/h speed limit when passing a school bus in either direction,” says RWNZ national president, Liz Evans.</p> 
<p>“Rural Women New Zealand is delighted with this initiative, which is an important part of raising driver awareness of this Road Code rule, which many motorists are unaware of, and which is almost universally ignored.</p> 
<p>“Bus drivers tell us that motorists are regularly passing school buses at 80km/h above the speed limit.&nbsp; This leaves children very vulnerable, especially when they are being dropped off in rural areas with no pavements.&nbsp; A moment’s inattention, or a child’s inability to judge speeds, can mean death or serious injury.”</p> 
<p>The shocking statistics speak for themselves:&nbsp; In the 23 years since 1987, 23 children have been killed when crossing the road to or from school buses.&nbsp; A further 47 have been seriously injured and 92 have received minor injuries. By comparison, six children were killed while actually on a school bus.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Last year 36 children were injured when a logging truck in the Bay of Plenty rear-ended a school bus that had stopped to let children off.</p> 
<p>Eight-five percent of the accidents happen in the afternoon on the way home from school and while 62 percent of the crashes are in 50km/hr zones, 85 percent of fatalities are on high speed roads, many of which are in rural areas.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand has written to Police Roading National Manager Superintendent Paula Rose, asking her to issue a national directive for all police districts to follow the Southern District’s lead and follow school buses for the first two weeks of every school term to enforce the 20km/h rule.</p> 
<p>“A school bus safety forum we held in Wellington last November highlighted that there is no one solution to the problem of reducing accidents involving children using school buses.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“However, enforcement of the speed limit by police, along with active signage on buses and education of drivers and children were all identified as vital components.”</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>We got great media coverage from this article! To name a few...</p>

        <title>Walking Access seeks feedback on mapping system 20-Feb-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, February 20, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>The New Zealand Walking Access Commission wants your feedback on its Walking Access Mapping System (<a href="http://wams.org.nz/wams/">www.wams.org.nz</a>).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The mapping system was opened to the public last year to make planning visits to the outdoors easier. It identifies land over which the public has access and shows the boundaries of private land, making it easier for people to know when and where they must ask for access permission.</p> 
<p>You can provide feedback on the Walking Access Mapping System by filling out the Commission’s short survey, <a href="http://sgiz.mobi/s3/WAMS-Survey">online here</a>. <strong>All survey respondents go into the draw to win $250 worth of petrol vouchers. </strong></p>

        <title>Mobile coverage a reality for three rural communities 20-Feb-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, February 20, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Three small rural communities, two in the South Island and one in the North, will get mobile phone coverage this year, as the first successful applicants in the <a href="http://www.vodafone.co.nz/smart-network/community-cell-site/">Vodafone community cellsite scheme</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The residents of Waihau Bay in the East Cape, and North and South Catlins in the South Island were among several communities who applied for the scheme, which is available to the 2 per cent of New Zealand not covered by Vodafone’s network and outside the scope of the Rural Broadband Initiative.</p> 
<p>Vodafone’s chief network officer Tony Baird, says he was hugely impressed by the time and effort communities had committed to the application process.</p> 
<p>“When we opened this scheme in October we planned on funding two rural sites this year – one in the North Island and one in the South. But when the applications came in, they were of such high quality that we simply could not narrow down our selection to just two. So, we are pleased to be funding three sites this year. This positive result will ensure both residents and visitors to these coastal areas will now enjoy the freedom and accessibility of the Vodafone mobile network.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Jill Borland, co-ordinator of the north Catlins application and District Development Manager for Clutha District Council is delighted: “This is a huge boost for the entire Catlins area as an emerging international tourism destination. The benefits will be shared by residents, visitors and businesses alike and recognises the partnership between Clutha District Council and Venture Southland, and the huge effort in preparing the application invested by Tourism Catlins.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Venture Southland’s Community Development lead Bobbi Brown submitted an application alongside the south Catlins District community. “Venture Southland is thrilled that Vodafone is supporting a unique and deserving community” says Brown. “Improving cellular coverage will have life altering consequences for this local community . An improved ability to communicate will both save and enhance lives and will complement significant investment already committed to the area associated with several economic, tourism, infrastructural and community initiatives”.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Local business owner Derek Aubertin co-ordinated the application for Waihau Bay, Opotiki. “This is brilliant news, our community is in total support of making this scheme a reality.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new cellsites will be designed to give the broadest reach, and locations will be determined through suggestions from the local community, distance to power supply, and network requirements. Site survey work will start immediately.</p> 
<p>Applications for the scheme closed on 15 December and were individually assessed on the positive impact to the community and the community’s ability to meet the required criteria.</p> 
<p>Vodafone plans to run a second round of the Community Cellsite Scheme later this year and will invite applications from other small rural communities. <br> <br> <strong>About the scheme</strong></p> 
<p>Communities with no existing mobile coverage who applied were asked to demonstrate as many of the following criteria as possible to qualify for consideration:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Proximity to existing mains power supply</li> 
 <li>Letter of support from local MP(s)</li> 
 <li>Supporting petition of signed residents who desire the service and their assistance to obtain RMA consent</li> 
 <li>The location must be able to provide line of site options for microwave linking (Vodafone will need to determine this)</li> 
 <li>A willing landowner</li> 
 <li>Community willing to provide track maintenance</li> 
 <li>4WD vehicle access</li> 
 <li>Support of local iwi including contact person name and number</li> 
 <li>Support of local Council or Community Board member/s</li> 
 <li>Description of the positive impact the site will bring to the community</li> 
</ul>

        <title>Tapa Cloth Gift 27-Feb-2012</title>

<p>Rural Women Marlborough provincial branch international officer Melva Robb&nbsp;explains:&nbsp; Each year the Rural Women group focused on a different country, and last year the theme was Tonga.&nbsp; The group invited&nbsp;Theresa Veikoso&nbsp;to speak&nbsp;to the group about her Tongan 6culture. </p> 
<p>Melva Robb says&nbsp;that after Mrs Veikoso spoke to them the Marlborough women were inspired to help the Tongan community in some way. Mrs Veikoso suggested money they raised could go to a group making traditional tapa cloth, led by her aunt. The money was used to buy backing fabric used to make up to 50 metre-long tapa cloth, Mrs Veikoso said. </p> 
<p>To mark their thanks for the gift of money, the Tongan women made the Rural Women Marlborough provincial branch a tapa which covered the top table at the group's annual general meeting in Blenheim.</p> 
<p>Mrs Veikoso said the Tongan women saw the gift as a blessing and were amazed that rural women in Marlborough would help in this way. </p> 
<p>Tongan women make tapa cloth and mats from the inner bark of specially planted trees. The bark is soaked in water overnight, then placed flat and beaten to make tapa pieces, later joined to make large mats. </p>]]></body>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Safety regulators, agricultural and transport research institutes, farming associations,&nbsp; coroners and vehicle distributors have all expressed opinions on how to improve the safety of Quad bike users. </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Monash University and the Institute for Safety Compensation and Recovery Research (ISCRR) in Australia have recently completed a literature review to critically assess research&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13px;">relating to the efficacy of a crush protection device which can be fitted to Quad bikes, called the ‘Quad Bar’. </span></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This review identified serious issues with the simulation methods used and the nature of incidents tested to predict the effect of crush protection devices on Quad bike roll over injuries and fatalities. Limited experimental and simulation results indicate that the Quad Bar crush protection device demonstrates potential to reduce injuries and fatalities, particularly those arising from low speed lateral roll and back flip events. </span></p>

<p>Some walkers are being sponsored, while other groups are charging a small entry fee to raise funds.</p> 
<p>To help keep track of distances walked, the New Zealand Walking Access Commission has kindly sponsored a number of pedometers for each group.</p>

        <title>Book celebrates women on the land 18-Apr-2012</title>
        <date>Wednesday, April 18, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/MChapman_ Book launch.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/post/New_treasure_trove_of_stories_and_poetry_celebrates_women_on_the_land/"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/MChapman_ Book launch.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 188px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px solid;"></a>A new collection of writing published by South Canterbury Rural Women New Zealand is a treasure trove of stories and poems celebrating the lives and work of rural women.</p> 
<p>At last weekend’s launch of the anthology Ragwort and Thistles, Minister of Women’s Affairs and Rangitata MP, Jo Goodhew, said “Women were and women are the fabric of our land.”</p> 
<p>The Minister congratulated the 48 contributors - many of whom were in Timaru for the launch – saying the book of poetry and prose moved her and will become a treasured publication to many.<a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/shop/ragwort-and-thistles"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Mchapman Book Cover (2).jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 213px; float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; border: 0px solid;"></a></p> 
<p>President of Rural Women New Zealand’s South Canterbury Provincial, Margaret Chapman, says the publication of the book had been a big project.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“During 2011 we held a nationwide writing competition seeking original, non-published works of fiction, non-fiction and poetry that celebrated women and the role they play or have played on our land and in our rural communities.</p> 
<p>“In all, 321 entries were received, ranging from witty poems and moving stories about remarkable pioneer women who shaped our country, to modern stories about women farmers today.”</p> 
<p>A judging panel of five, including Pleasant Point writer Karalyn Joyce, had an incredibly hard job to select the 52 individual poems and stories that are included in the book.</p> 
<p>They chose as winner a short story called Ragwort and Thistles, by Marion Day of Picton, saying the story invoked clear and vivid memories.</p> 
<p>In a close second, was Milk and Honey, another very descriptive and well-written story by Annalisa Vaatstra of Wanganui.</p> 
<p>In third place came Madge, a beautiful character poem by Dawn McMillan of Thames.</p> 
<p>The book will have broad appeal for both rural and non-rural people.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“It’s a good read – designed to entertain, to inform and in many cases to evoke memories,” says Margaret Chapman.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“The book celebrates the vital part that women play in farming – in the past, present and into the future”.</p> 
<p>The book is available for purchase through Rural Women New Zealand’s website –<a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/shop/ragwort-and-thistles"> www.ruralwomen.org.nz&nbsp;</a></p>

        <title>Rural women walk the length of New Zealand for charity 01-May-2012</title>
        <date>Tuesday, May 01, 2012</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/post/Rural_women_walk_the_length_of_New_Zealand_for_charity/"><img alt="" style="width: 130px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; height: 98px; margin-right: 10px; border: 0px solid;" src="/images/blog/Viv Malneed photo 4.JPG"></a>Rural Women New Zealand members and friends walked the length of New Zealand yesterday, then turned round and walked halfway back again!</p> 
<p>The collective effort was part of the global Women Walk the World challenge to raise funds to help women in developing countries step up out of poverty.</p> 
<p>“The day was a huge success,” says Liz Evans. “Our members held 26 events around the country from Southland to Franklin.”</p> 
<p>“Our local challenge was to walk the length of New Zealand, or approximately 1600 kilometres. Our members did that and more!”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some four hundred walkers clocked up a total of 2,856 kilometers to raise funds for Associated Country Women of the World projects.</p> 
<p><img alt="" style="margin-top: 10px; width: 230px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: right; height: 181px; margin-left: 10px; border: 0px solid;" src="/Final WWTW Logo.jpg">The challenge saw several generations taking part, from babies in prams to at least two women in their mid-80s who walked more than five kilometres each, with the oldest walker aged 87!</p> 
<p>The distances covered were tallied up on pedometers supplied by the NZ Walking Access Commission.</p> 
<p>It’s Chief Executive, Mark Neeson, said the Commission was proud to be part of the the event.</p> 
<p>“Women Walk the World is an outstanding idea. Not only does it raise money for a worthy cause, but it also promotes healthy lifestyles, greater awareness of walking opportunities in rural settings and better understanding of life outside urban centres.”</p> 
<p>Money was raised through gold coin entry fees, sponsorship and raffles.&nbsp;</p>

        <title>Premier fundraising award for aftersocks™ campaign 14-May-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, May 14, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Belinda and Emma with Award.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Belinda and Emma with Award.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 113px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px solid;">Rural Women New Zealand’s innovative aftersocks™ fundraiser for Canterbury earthquake victims has achieved the highest accolade at the Fundraising Institute of New Zealand’s (FINZ) annual awards.</p> 
<p>At the ceremony held in Auckland on Friday evening, aftersocks™ was first announced as the winner of the FINZ Online Campaign category.</p> 
<p>But the highlight of the evening came with the announcement of the night’s top award.</p> 
<p>Aftersocks™ was named as the joint winner, along with Ronald McDonald House, South Island, of the Premier Fundraising Award for Excellence 2012.</p> 
<p>FINZ CEO, James Austin, said the Premier award is only made if in the opinion of the judges it is truly merited.</p> 
<p>He said, “[aftersocks™] was one of those rare campaigns – and award entries – that has ‘winner’ written all over it from go-to-whoa.”</p> 
<p>The inventiveness and ability to think laterally were winning aspects of both aftersocks™ and the Ronald McDonald ‘Supper Club @ Home’ event.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Both organisations are thoroughly deserving of jointly receiving the Premier Award for Fundraising Excellence for two extraordinary but very different campaigns.”</p> 
<p>Rural Women NZ’s national president, Liz Evans, says she is thrilled with the wins, which recognise the efforts of Rural Women NZ members and office staff in marketing and selling the socks.</p> 
<p>The reach of social media played a large part in the sales success of the funky red and black striped socks, which incorporate the seismograph graphic of the 22nd February 2010 quake.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Our national office was transformed into a packaging and dispatch centre, with thousands of courier bags sent out all over the world.</p> 
<p>“We aimed to sell 1,000 pairs, but through social networking aftersocks™ caught people’s imaginations and sales rocketed. We’ve now sold close to 19,000 pairs.”</p> 
<p>The socks are manufactured in Ashburton by the NZ Sock Company, and are made from a New Zealand merino wool blend.</p> 
<p>Over $110,000 has so far been raised for the Christchurch Mayoral Fund, with a final wash up payment to be made once remaining stocks are sold.</p> 
<p>Socks can be purchased at <a href="http://aftersocks.co.nz/">www.aftersocks.co.nz</a></p>

        <title>RWNZ applauds coroners call for action 16-May-2012</title>
        <date>Wednesday, May 16, 2012</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/post/RWNZ_applauds_coroner%E2%80%99s_call_for_action_/"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/School bus.jpg" style="width: 120px; height: 90px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px solid;"></a>Rural Women New Zealand endorses the call by the chief coroner for it to become mandatory for coroners’ recommendations to be responded to by Government agencies.</p> 
<p>“We agree with Judge Neil MacLean that coroners’ recommendations need to be considered and acted upon in order to save lives,” says RWNZ national president, Liz Evans.</p> 
<p>“As an example, for the last five years Rural Women New Zealand has been advocating for more to be done to remind drivers of the 20km/h speed limit when passing a stationary school bus.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“At least two coroners’ reports have recommended improved signage on buses as a way of reminding drivers of the need to slow down, as well as alerting drivers that a school bus has stopped ahead.”</p> 
<p>In March Transport Engineering Research New Zealand conducted a trial of active 20km/h signs which showed encouraging results. However the signs are still not approved for use on school buses.</p> 
<p>“The technology is now available and Rural Women New Zealand has evidence of a huge public support for such signs. It’s time for action,” says Mrs Evans.</p> 
<p>Many school communities have indicated they would consider fundraising to cover the cost of the active 20km/h signs, but first they must be approved for use.</p> 
<p>In the 23 years since 1987, twenty-three children have been killed in New Zealand when crossing the road to or from school buses, while 47 have been seriously injured and 92 have received minor injuries.</p> 
<p>Last year 35 children and the bus driver were injured when a logging truck hit the rear of a school bus near Ruatoki in the Bay of Plenty.<br> <br> For the report on the 20km/h school bus signs trial <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/tag/School_Bus_Signs/">Click HERE.</a></p>]]></body>

<p><span style="line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px;"><br> </span></p> 
<p><span style="line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px;"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Jenny Scott and Graeme Titcombe.jpg.JPG" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 100px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">The&nbsp;</span><strong style="line-height: 21px;">Access Homehealth South Island Award 2012</strong><span style="line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;winner was Jenny Scott of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.livestockoffice.com/" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit;">Livestock Office</a><span style="line-height: 21px; font-size: 13px;">, a stock agent brokering software company</span><span style="font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; background-color: white;">.&nbsp; The business is based at Bannockburn near Cromwell.</span>&nbsp;<br> <br> </p> 
<p>“The Real Dog Equipment Company is an example of what can be achieved when you have a passion and are willing to follow your dreams,” says Rural Women New Zealand national president, Liz Evans.&nbsp; “We warmly congratulate Rose on her very deserving win.”</p> 
<p>Rose set out on her enterprising journey making harnesses and collars for her sled racing dogs.&nbsp; This has grown into a very successful business producing quality animal equipment designed by Rose and manufactured by her and her husband at the company’s purpose-built premises near Ranfurly.&nbsp; It’s also home to the family and their 13 sled dogs.</p> 
<p>“What started as a hobby has grown into an impressive venture producing a wide range of equipment for dogs, alpacas and horses.&nbsp; The Real Dog Equipment Company even exports sled dog equipment to Alaska, the home of sled dog racing!” says Liz.</p> 
<p>The judges were impressed by Rose’s innovation and dedication to producing high quality products with good growth potential.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>They also appreciated Rose’s community involvement, often repairing sports gear for children in the district, for example.</p> 
<p>Most of her company’s sales are conducted through the internet, proving Rose’s point that with a website and a courier service she could build her business anywhere, which allowed her to move from the city back to her roots in Central Otago.&nbsp; She also uses the internet to upload instruction movies on training dogs and using her equipment.</p> 
<p>The judges were impressed by the winner of the <strong>Telecom North Island Award</strong>. &nbsp; Kylie Gibbard’s drive and business acumen guarantee strong growth for Emkay Ltd, which evolved from Kylie’s need to find a comfortable support bra that she could wear all day on the farm.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Kylie has a strong vision and a can-do attitude that have helped her to take a problem, find a solution and turn the answer into an enterprise with huge potential,” says Liz Evans.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Kylie started out wanting to design a comfortable bra for her own needs, but went well beyond a ‘number eight wire’ solution.&nbsp; Emkay bras are the result of five years’ extensive research and product development, and use the highest quality Spanish lingerie fabric, which is laser cut for precision.&nbsp; Originally designed for the 14DD+ niche market, the bras are now available in an 8B to 40HH sizes.</p> 
<p>After launching the Emkay bra just two years ago, the company has already broken into the Australian market and is rapidly building its stockist base in New Zealand.&nbsp; The Emkay bra is sold solely through stores, following retailer training.&nbsp; This personal approach is an important part of the Emkay philosophy and one that translates into an impressive nine-six percent try on to purchase ratio.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Access Homehealth South Island</strong> winner, Jenny Scott, has over 20 years experience in the market, a solid client base and a proven product,” says Liz Evans.&nbsp; “T<span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-color: white;">he judges were also impressed with the fact that Livestock Office hasn’t stood still, and is meeting today’s market </span>using e-sales and mobile phone technology.”</p> 
<p>Livestock Office is used by l<span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-color: white;">ivestock and grazing brokering firms throughout the country</span> and is the only specialised livestock brokering software developed in New Zealand for local conditions.&nbsp; It also has potential to be used internationally, which is the company’s focus for the immediate future.&nbsp; The package includes debtors, creditors, cashbook and general ledger and can handle all types of sales including private, grazing and auction.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Threats to home-based care for older persons highlighted in Human Rights Commission report 01-Jun-2012</title>
        <date>Friday, June 01, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Threats to home-based care for older persons highlighted in Human Rights Commission report </p> 
<p><span>Rural Women New Zealand and the Council for Christian Social Services, in a joint statement, agree that the <strong>Report of the</strong> <strong>Inquiry into the Aged Care Workforce ‘Caring Counts’</strong> by the Human Rights Commission clearly highlights the issues for both carers and the providers of the service. </span></p> 
<p>The indicated lack of response by Government to this Report threatens the on-going ability of NGOs to continue to provide home based older persons’ services in New Zealand. It is not acceptable for Government to continually transfer the cost of providing vital older person services from District Health Boards to NGOs. </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand President, Liz Evans, said “Ministers cannot continue to claim that Government is providing an increasing quality of services and carer training when all they are simply doing is requiring NGOs to meet increasing quality standards and higher levels of carer training at the unfunded cost of the NGO.” </p> 
<p>The Government legislates for increases to the minimum wage and yet provides no additional funding to NGOs to meet this new cost imposition; similarly it increases the employer contribution for Kiwisaver without a cost contribution. </p> 
<p>At the same time, DHBs divert older persons’ funding into their delivery of secondary services and fail to pass on inflation increases; some DHBs have not passed on an inflation increase for three years. The Government cannot claim that they are increasing funding for older persons services when they have no mechanism for ensuring that DHBs are utilising existing funding for such services. </p> 
<p>While NGOs have struggled to maintain services under these circumstances they have no ability to meet the valid concerns in regard to carers’ wages and travel reimbursements. The NGO sector has strived for many years to gain meaningful dialogue with Government in an attempt to address these injustices. </p> 
<p>“We do not believe that Government appreciates the degree of the crisis now facing NGOs in the home based older persons sector; it has been ten years in the making and the continual failure of Government to address it illustrates the low level of priority given to older persons’ services. </p> 
<p>“It is not acceptable for Ministers to say, once again, that the issues will be addressed when the country’s accounts are in a stronger financial position, while in the meantime some DHBs continue to exploit the NGO sector and its workforce. NGOs will simply not be able to sustain the current level of services.” said Mrs Evans.</p>

        <title>Pets used as Pawns in Domestic Violence 04-Jun-2012</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/pets as pawns.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 210px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">When women are considering leaving a violent relationship many think twice because of fears that their pets and other animals will be killed or tortured.</p> 
<p>That’s according to a new study Pets as Pawns commissioned by the SPCA and Women’s Refuge, where 50% of women interviewed had witnessed animal cruelty as part of their experience of domestic violence.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand has taken the initiative to bring together representatives from SPCA, Women’s Refuge, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, NZ Veterinary Association and Federated Farmers to discuss the report and find solutions that work for rural communities.</p> 
<p>“When it comes to animal cruelty and&nbsp;family violence in a rural setting, it’s&nbsp;not a case of picking up the cat and&nbsp;packing your bags. We need to find&nbsp;solutions that work for rural.”<br> Noeline Holt, RWNZ EO</p>

        <title>The fight against lepto - the impact on families 15-Jun-2012</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" style="width: 150px; height: 99px; border: 0px solid;" src="/images/blog/Region 6 Story 3 Coin trail 2 Margaret Seager.jpg"> 
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The fight against leptospirosis – Rural Women paints the human picture at the NZVA conference</span></strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Rural Women New Zealand will highlight the devastating impacts on families of leptospirosis, a disease that can be passed from infected animals to humans, at the New Zealand Veterinary Association conference in Hamilton next week.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Fiona Gower, an RWNZ member from Port Waikato, will put the human face on leptospirosis, which is a key health concern for rural people, as New Zealand has one of the highest rates of infection in the world.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Liz Evans, RWNZ national president, says if farm animals are affected it can lead to severe stress for farmers dealing with poor animal health, a drop in milk production, poor reproduction and loss of stock.&nbsp; </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“But when a family member or members contract the disease the impacts are huge,” she says.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Depending on the severity of the case, it will mean a long illness and recovery time, and at worst, death.&nbsp; Emotionally the stress on the family of having a sick spouse, parent or child is incredible – not knowing when or if they will get better.”</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Rural Women New Zealand has collected heart-rending stories from people who’ve caught the disease - the months and even years taken from people’s lives, and the long term impacts on their health and financial situations.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">One said, “After I contracted lepto my husband was so terrified of the disease he sold the farm.”&nbsp; Another said “In the first week I thought I would die; then I wished that I had.”</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Mrs Evans says strengthening links between the research and medical sectors and the rural community is key to eradicating lepto.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Working collaboratively we can raise awareness of leptospirosis and how to prevent it through vaccination of stock and good hygiene practices. </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“In people, early diagnosis and treatment are also important in minimising its severity and long-term effects.&nbsp; </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“We strongly suggest that </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; color: black;">rural people and farmers presenting at their GP with non-specific symptoms should always request that a test for leptospirosis be included in the blood test line-up, although antibodies will not be present for two to three weeks.”</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; color: black;">In people the mild form of lepto is a minor flu-like sickness, but without the respiratory symptoms.&nbsp; The severe form may include extreme headaches, high fever, nausea, muscle pain, breathing and vision problems and diarrhoea.&nbsp; About half of people with severe lepto are hospitalised, and there can be permanent complications from kidney or liver damage.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Rural Women New Zealand is the chair of the Farmers Leptospirosis Action Group, which is conducting SFF-funded research into leptospirosis at Massey University, looking at the cost-benefits of vaccinating sheep and cattle.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">RWNZ has been involved in the fight to stamp out leptospirosis since the 1970s.&nbsp; At that time, members raised over $150,000 to fund research that led to the development of vaccines for dairy cattle and pigs.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">With the death of a meat worker at a sheep-only plant in 2006, Rural Women NZ members mobilised once more, raising $107,000 for further research at Massey into transmission pathways from animals to farmers and meat workers.</span></p>]]></body>

We have been supported with donations from some local businesses also.”</p> 
<p>The group donated 200 vests to three schools in its catchment area, Amuri Area School, Rotherham and Waiau Schools. The vests have our RWNZ logo printed on the back.<br> Popular with the kids</p> 
<p>“We have had to reorder as the years 5 and 6 [children] also wanted to wear the vests. It has been a pleasure seeing the children wearing their vests going to school. They are also being used during school trips,” says Sharron.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Rural schools back to the community 22-Jun-2012</title>
        <date>Friday, June 22, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women New Zealand is calling on the Minister of Education to gift or lease closed rural schools to local communities, and has requested a meeting with Minister Hekia Parata to discuss the proposal.</p> 
<p>“Over the years many rural schools have closed when the Ministry has decided they are no longer viable, and often the buildings are left to fall into disrepair,” says Rural Women New Zealand national president, Liz Evans.</p> 
<p>“We’d like to see them gifted or leased at a peppercorn rent to the local community so that they can breathe new life into them and put them to good use.”<br> Liz Evans says the buildings could be used for playgroups, a venue for adult training or workshops, or to bring rural children together for correspondence or teacher-led school lessons as well as extra curricula activities.<br> “It could mean an alternative to long bus journeys to take children to other schools outside the district.”<br> She says the Government is promoting community solutions to community issues, and Rural Women New Zealand believes gifting unused school buildings will lead to creative and smart uses of these assets, which are currently being wasted.<br> “We are aware of some communities who are looking at fundraising to retain a qualified teacher, and others that are investigating business partnerships to keep their rural schools open.”<br> Rural Women New Zealand says rural areas continue to attract young people, and by making the most of existing resources, such as disused school buildings, we can help to grow resilient communities, without blowing the budget.</p>

        <title>Update from NZ Post 22-Jun-2012</title>
        <date>Friday, June 22, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/NZ Post.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/NZ Post.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 100px; height: 75px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">New Zealand Post recently presented at our National Conference in Hawera on how declining mail volumes and increasing fixed costs are affecting their ability to sustain their current business model.</p> 
<p>They have made a commitment to closely engage with Rural Women New Zealand to ensure the rural community is kept informed, with the aim of ensuring there is a viable, sustainable network for the future.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Below is an update from New Zealand Post on the current situation.<br> <br> • In the past decade the volume of mail carried by New Zealand Post has fallen by 20%. That drop in volume is continuing, with nearly 40 million fewer mail items posted in the past year alone. We estimate that mail volumes will halve by 2018.<br> • The costs of maintaining a postal delivery network have increased in the past decade with a 20% growth in the number of addresses New Zealand Post is required to deliver to at least five or six days per week.</p> 
<p>Those two trends – declining volumes and increasing fixed costs - will continue as people increasingly choose to share information and documents electronically through using email, TXT, Twitter, Facebook, and Skype, to name a few. The planned rollout of high-speed broadband will further advance these trends, as a growing number of people take advantage of the convenience of digital messaging channels.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Zealand Post has various initiatives underway to ensure a sustainable postal services network in the future. These include redesigning our mail processing and delivery networks, developing digital options through which our customers can choose how they receive their items, and we’re planning for a network that is flexible so we can quickly adapt to meet the rapidly changing needs of people.</p> 
<p>We’re designing and planning this work now to make sure we do what’s right for customers and the business from two to three years and beyond. However, we believe the lead–in times to achieve the change are years rather than months.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To help achieve these necessary changes we are seeking amendments to the Deed of Understanding with the Crown, which hasn’t had any substantial updates since 1998. We expect the Government to call for public submissions on a discussion document on the Deed this year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As part of amending the Deed, we are seeking flexibility around delivery frequency and the shape of the postal outlet network. We know we have to adapt the delivery network to match the way people are using physical mail, and the current six-day delivery to more than 95 percent of delivery points simply won’t work in the years to come without both significant and frequent price increases – or seeking a subsidy from the Government. Neither option would be sustainable and would merely stave off the inevitable for a short period.</p> 
<p>We need to be ready to adjust delivery frequency which we know has a significant lead-in time. We need the flexibility in our agreement with the Government now, so we can change in the future. Waiting and doing nothing means we would lack the ability to provide certainty around price and service.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 1998 Deed also requires New Zealand Post to maintain a retail network of at least 880 postal outlets, of which 240 must include ‘agency services’. While valid at the time, the reality these days is that there is a multitude of other ways to access ‘agency services’ outside of a ‘shop’ environment with technology enabling a wide range of retail outlets to provide agency services. It might also be appropriate to examine the presumption (in the 1998 Deed) that New Zealand Post should be tied to the provision of agency services – which are increasingly able to be met efficiently using digital means and through the private sector. New Zealand Post wants to provide services through a wider range of points of presence rather than be locked into a set number of ‘bricks and mortar’ locations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An important point to note here – and one which will become an issue as the media is bound to speculate on possible scenarios – we’re not talking about sudden or impulsive changes. We’re looking to ensure sustainability for the next decade and this year needs to see our “first steps” in establishing the policy framework so we can make necessary steps in the future. There will be no ‘sudden moves’ and we are committed to keeping you informed.&nbsp;</p>

        <title>Preserving Skills go down a Treat 22-Jun-2012</title>
        <date>Friday, June 22, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Diane Higgins and co at Nelson workshop.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Diane Higgins and co at Nelson workshop.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 136px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">It was enough to get anyone in a pickle, but our Nelson women were unflappable!&nbsp;When A Good Harvest was first released, the Nelson Environment Centre contacted our Nelson members asking them to run a preserving workshop to share their bottling, pickling, jam and chutney making skills with young women in the community.</p> 
<p>They agreed, but an extra challenge came when the hall was needed for a tangi, and the workshop was shifted to a school staffroom nearby.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Gabi Abeltshauser, says: “With an oven but no stove top, there was one portable electric hotplate, a microwave and a gas burner that went flat out or not at all!</p> 
<p>“The Nelson ladies rose to the challenge and managed to bottle pears and apples, make pineapple and onion chutney, pear and cinnamon jam, process and bottle tomatoes and bottle red beet. Margaret (Faulkner) had her dehydrator there and produced dried apple and kiwifruit and fruit leathers.</p> 
<p>“The people who attended helped peel and cut up fruit, took notes, peered into pots and the oven, asked questions and went away feeling that the “mystery” had been taken out of preserving.”</p> 
<p>Carolyn Hughes, Manager of the Nelson Environment Centre, was delighted with the way the day went. “The three hour workshop covered everything you need to know about preserving, from sterilisation of containers, bottling, processing using either a water bath or automatic preserver, to storage. The enthusiasm as participants moved between each of the four workstations and dived into the preparation, demonstrations, tastings and sharing of tips and recipes was contagious.”</p> 
<p>Lynne Harrison, a workshop participant, was very impressed with the day. “Rural Women NZ are an untapped source of wisdom, humour and good sense.” &nbsp;Lynne said our four presenters were “down-to-earth, practical and sensible” and she hoped they would continue to share their many skills with regular workshops on preserving and other practical themes.</p> 
<p>Nelson Provincial members are keen to do it again next year - in a bigger, better kitchen!</p>]]></body>

        <title>Award for Southland Foresters 24-Jun-2012</title>
        <date>Sunday, June 24, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Ann Patsy and Rhonda.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/post/Landcare_Trust_Award_for_Southland_Foresters/"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Ann Patsy and Rhonda.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 134px; height: 100px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></a>The forward thinking of Southland members from the 1940s who bought land and planted a forest at Castledowns near Dipton is finally reaping financial rewards - and accolades.</p> 
<p>The Rural Women New Zealand Forest Committee Southland Inc was recently named as the winner of this year’s NZ Landcare Trust Award for Innovation in Sustainable Farm Forestry.</p> 
<p>And after many years of poor economic returns the 2010 harvest saw a welcome financial turnaround, producing a $328,000 revenue cheque. The logging profits are shared amongst the four Southland Provincials to distribute for charitable purposes in Southland, meaning the benefits flow back into the community.</p> 
<p>In presenting the award, Ian Jackson, President of the NZ Farm Forestry Association, said “This project has influenced many generations to plant trees on their own farms, and as such made a huge contribution to education and sustainable land management in Southland.”</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Ann Irving and friends selling cookbook at Riverton.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 134px; height: 100px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">A Good Harvest is proving to be another winning recipe from members of Rural Women New Zealand! Around 6,000 copies have been sold, and the new cookbook sat at number three on Nielsen’s Bestsellers List for non-fiction for several weeks following the launch in March.</p> 
<p>We’ve received huge publicity for the book in such high-flying publications as Air New Zealand’s Kia Ora magazine, as well as many reviews in community, regional and national newspapers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our publicist at Random House, Jennifer Balle, says “As to be expected, heartland media have absolutely loved the new book. But so too have some of the glamour pusses like NZ House &amp; Garden, The Dish, Next and NZ Gardener.”</p> 
<p>“This is a slice of rural New Zealand you’ll turn to time and time again” - The Dish</p> 
<p>“Knowledge born of experience emanates from the pages of this compendium…..” - NZ House &amp; Garden.</p> 
<p>One online gardening magazine received 1,000 entries for a competition to win a copy of the book!</p> 
<p>Our members, have also been out there doing a tremendous job in celebrating its publication, selling the book and sharing your ‘knowledge born of experience’.</p> 
<p>The Harvest Festival in Riverton, the Rai Valley Show, and Kaipara Provincial’s Garden Party are just a few of the launch events you’ve told us about.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At Riverton members made a selection of recipes – jams, relishes and pickles - and put them in shiny new jars purchased from national office. They also had tastings.</p> 
<p>“People wanted to purchase the products in the jars but our response was that they would have to buy the book, which 22 did!” says Ann Irving.</p> 
<p>“We had the books on display and had a draw for the book. As a result of the competition we have 68 names to follow up and one new member. The result of our work this weekend has been very exciting and I would encourage all branches to have a go as it’s a lot of fun.”</p>

<p>The Provincials were pleased to help and recently presented the Trust with a much newer model, complete with the Rural Women New Zealand logo.</p> 
<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Southland Life Education Trust Car.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 134px; height: 100px; float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">The money came from the proceeds of timber milling at the Dipton forest, which was planted by the RWNZ Southland Provincials in the 1950s and has recently started to make a good return from timber.</p> 
<p>The RWNZ groups in the area have been strong supporters of the Southland Life Education Community Trust since 1989, including members serving as trustees. The Southland Life Education Trust will be celebrating its 20th anniversary at St John’s Girls School in Invercargill in May.</p>]]></body>

        <title>The Fight Continues Against Lepto 25-Jun-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, June 25, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Fiona.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/_blog/News_and_Inspiration/post/The_Fight_Continues_Against_Lepto/"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Fiona.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 134px; height: 100px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></a>Rural Women New Zealand recently highlighted the devastating impacts on families of leptospirosis, a disease that can be passed from infected animals to humans, at the New Zealand Veterinary Association conference in Hamilton last week.</p> 
<p>Fiona Gower, an RWNZ member from Port Waikato, put the human face on leptospirosis, which is a key health concern for rural people, as New Zealand has one of the highest rates of infection in the world.</p> 
<p>Liz Evans, RWNZ national president, says if farm animals are affected it can lead to severe stress for farmers dealing with poor animal health, a drop in milk production, poor reproduction and loss of stock. <br> “But when a family member or members contract the disease the impacts are huge,” she says.<br> “Depending on the severity of the case, it will mean a long illness and recovery time, and at worst, death. Emotionally the stress on the family of having a sick spouse, parent or child is incredible – not knowing when or if they will get better.”</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand has collected heart-rending stories from people who’ve caught the disease - the months and even years taken from people’s lives, and the long term impacts on their health and financial situations.<br> One said, “After I contracted lepto my husband was so terrified of the disease he sold the farm.” Another said “In the first week I thought I would die; then I wished that I had.”<br> Mrs Evans says strengthening links between the research and medical sectors and the rural community is key to eradicating lepto.<br> “Working collaboratively we can raise awareness of leptospirosis and how to prevent it through vaccination of stock and good hygiene practices.</p> 
<p>“In people, early diagnosis and treatment are also important in minimising its severity and long-term effects. <br> “We strongly suggest that rural people and farmers presenting at their GP with non-specific symptoms should always request that a test for leptospirosis be included in the blood test line-up, although antibodies will not be present for two to three weeks.”</p> 
<p>In people the mild form of lepto is a minor flu-like sickness, but without the respiratory symptoms. The severe form may include extreme headaches, high fever, nausea, muscle pain, breathing and vision problems and diarrhoea. About half of people with severe lepto are hospitalised, and there can be permanent complications from kidney or liver damage.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand is the chair of the Farmers Leptospirosis Action Group, which is conducting SFF-funded research into leptospirosis at Massey University, looking at the cost-benefits of vaccinating sheep and cattle.</p> 
<p>RWNZ has been involved in the fight to stamp out leptospirosis since the 1970s. At that time, members raised over $150,000 to fund research that led to the development of vaccines for dairy cattle and pigs.<br> With the death of a meat worker at a sheep-only plant in 2006, Rural Women NZ members mobilised once more, raising $107,000 for further research at Massey into transmission pathways from animals to farmers and meat workers.</p>

        <title>What Affects Uptake of High Speed Broadband: Study 28-Jun-2012</title>
        <date>Thursday, June 28, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Following the introduction of the Ultra Fast Broadband (UFB) and Rural Broadband initiatives, the Commerce Commission looked at what factors may affect uptake of high speed broadband services by consumers and businesses.</p> 
<p>The needs of rural users were highlighted in the report. The report says rural users have the same appetite for fast broadband as urban users, but have a more fundamental need, which is to be connected to basic broadband. They are concerned that they could be left behind as NZ moves forward with high speed broadband services.&nbsp;</p> The study also identified two main areas as being important to consumers from all sectors – costs relating to connecting and using high speed broadband, and the availability of video-on-demand services: 
<div>
 <br> 
 <ul> 
  <li>the expense of connecting to the UFB network and using high speed broadband services is critical for many people, and the current high costs are likely to slow down the uptake for both consumers and SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises); and</li> 
  <li>video content is likely to be what mostly drives consumers’ uptake of high speed broadband services over the next few years, and UFB uptake is likely to be higher if there is a good range of video-on-demand options available to consumers (currently, however, there are limited online video on demand services in NZ compared with many other countries).

        <title>Bank to Use Dairy Farm Data 28-Jun-2012</title>
        <date>Thursday, June 28, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>ANZ New Zealand, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with dairy industry organisation Dairy NZ to work together to boost the financial performance of dairy farms. The memorandum – which runs for five years - is the first between a bank and Dairy NZ.</p> 
<p>The MoU will enable ANZ economists and Agri Managers to use information from Dairy NZ’s business performance analysis tool, Dairy Base. Dairy Base brings together the financial results from over 1800 farmers, and provides a basis for someone to compare their farm against other similar farms. ANZ will have access to the same data farmers and farm accountants use to analyse and compare farm performance, and will use these to work with its dairy farming clients. </p>

        <title>Rural Pharmacists Wanted; Bonding Scheme Needs Extending 02-Jul-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, July 02, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>The Pharmacy Guild says that the Government’s voluntary bonding scheme has failed to include pharmacists in its recent widening - even though the sector struggles to retain staff in rural areas.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As it currently stands, the scheme encourages newly-qualified doctors, nurses, and midwives to start their careers in hard-to-staff communities and specialties by offering payments to student loans after a three to five year bonded period. <br> The Guild would like the Government to expand the scheme to include pharmacists. Community pharmacy has had difficulty attracting and retaining professional staff in rural areas for some time. The Guild believes inclusion of pharmacists and interns in the voluntary bonding scheme would help lessen staff shortages in rural pharmacy and therefore improve access to health care for rural populations.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Marion White_small.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;">My name is Piri, I am an eight month old seal point Birman. I like retrieving balls of wool from the wool basket; tossing and dragging them around the house until they are an unravelled mess. When hungry, I also like biting toes. When feeling playful, which is most of the time, I love tossing my toys around the house; hunting them down and pouncing on them, and that includes chunks of real meat!</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/xena.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;">I’m Xena the four year old Burmese cross. I like butter, cheese and purring and can pick food up with my paw and eat it. I am pretty clever and can even tip over the kitty kitchen and make food appear like magic!</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Laura Harry with diva_small.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;">&nbsp;I’m Diva, a 14 week old German Shorthaired Pointer. I love showers as I dance around and around with my big floppy ears spraying water all over the place. I love running really fast into the shower so the water splashes and then I race back out and do it all over again. I try really hard to lap up the water before it disappears down the drain and stand staring in total amazement when I can’t get it all. And if anyone is in the shower, I absolutely love licking the water that runs down their legs. The first time I did it I heard a scream but now it’s just all giggles so I lick toes as well now – humans are really quite funny in the shower!</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Zsofi_ Jackie Whitehead.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;">I’m Zsofi, an eight year old Irish Setter. I just love helping out around the farm - my owners call me their supervisor because I'm always around and trying to lend them a hand milking the cows, especially down in the pit. I love any spilt milk or the occasional cow poo - Yummy!!! <br> I also love to carry around bones and lounging on the leather sofa. I can stretch out on my back feet up in the air and snooze all day - love it!!!</p> 
<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Helen Coop2.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;">I'm Ducko the duck. I love cuddling up to Bucko the lamb, nothing like a nice snuggle between friends in the springtime sun.</p>

        <title>Briefing Paper: Vulnerable Children 12-Jul-2012</title>
        <date>Thursday, July 12, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>A new briefing paper released by UNICEF NZ, entitled “What Will it Take”, summarises the common themes from 80 organisations’(including Rural Women New Zealand) recent submissions to the Government’s Green Paper on Vulnerable Children. “What Will it Take” is intended to help drive discussion and inform debate ahead of the Government’s White Paper for children.</p> 
<p>There are strong similar themes amongst submissions from all organisations. The most common theme in submissions is that the best way to do better for vulnerable children is to do better for all children. In addition, the submissions call for: an Action Plan for all children; priority to be given to investing in children and their wellbeing; increased emphasis on proactively looking for ways to support families and communities in their role of nurturing children; work to eliminate violence in families and communities and address inequities, especially child poverty.</p> 
<p>The briefing paper makes 10 recommendations across four broad areas (sharing responsibilities, showing leadership, child-centred policy, child-centred practice). The main recommendations include:<br> • Government acknowledges and meets its fundamental responsibility by shaping, maintaining and promoting a child and family-friendly society;<br> • parents are fully supported to meet their responsibilities by having access to a wide range of free or affordable support services;<br> • community-led initiatives are encouraged and enabled;<br> • local government is recognized as having a critical social role in local communities;<br> • an Action Plan for all children in NZ be developed and put in place;<br> • investment be made in joint workforce development, including the development of a common set of values, standards and protocols, but not at the expense of service delivery to children; and<br> • positive and effective approaches to service delivery and community building be shared and their use encouraged.<br> <br> “What Will it Take”, including further background information, can be viewed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unicef.org.nz/greenpaper">clicking&nbsp;HERE</a></p>

        <title>A Pat on the Back for Pharmac 12-Jul-2012</title>
        <date>Thursday, July 12, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women New Zealand congratulates Pharmac’s decision to provide Iressa as a targeted treatment for non-squamous advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&nbsp;This is a boon for rural patients who will qualify for this simple pill for their treatment.</p> 
<p>“Having cancer is distressing enough and for rural patients and their families and having to travel long distances to receive treatment is an added burden”, says RWNZ spokesperson for health, Kerry Maw. “As an organisation that advocates for access and equity we often hear of the difficulties families have in receiving first-line treatment for serious illnesses. So having a simple pill they can take at home will make it that much easier for people to cope with an illness.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“However, when people are taking such medication at home we believe it’s really important that they are well supported by practice/district nurses or homecare workers", says Mrs Maw.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand is hopeful that this new treatment option is a lead-in to other similar developments in health service delivery (such as the Integrated Family Health Centres), which gives more choice to rural families, allowing them to receive treatment closer to or at home.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Wakanui Beef Cheek Cannelloni 13-Jul-2012</title>
        <date>Friday, July 13, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Ben B_BeefLamb.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Ben B_BeefLamb.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 151px; height: 100px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Award winning executive chef and New Zealand Beef and Lamb Ambassador, Ben Batterbury recently gave a demonstration in sunny Winton, infront of a SOLD OUT and very discerning audience of Rural Women New Zealand members and friends.</p> 
<p>RWNZ Beef + Lamb Cooking Demonstrations are taking place around New Zealand over the coming months. <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/events/index.html">Click here to find out more.</a></p> 
<p>Below is the recipe for just one of the fabulous dishes Ben created.</p> 
<p><strong>Wakanui Beef Cheek Cannelloni, Braised Lentils, Malted Parsnip Puree and Licorice</strong></p> 
<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Beef Cheeks.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 300px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Serves approx 8<br> Beef Cheeks<br> 1kg Beef cheeks (we use Wakanui grain fed)<br> 1 Carrot<br> 1 Onion<br> 1 stick Celery<br> 1 sprig thyme<br> 2 cloves Garlic<br> 1 ltr Chicken stock<br> 1 Bottle Dark malty beer (approx 4-500ml)<br> 200ml Red Wine<br> 100g butter</p> 
<p>Chop all the vegetables into large pieces. In a pan add half the butter and wait until it foams then add the vegetables, garlic and herbs. Sweat for five minutes then add all the liquids and simmer until ready to use. Pat the cheeks dry on a cloth and season with salt. In a pan add the other half of butter and wait until it foams then add the cheeks and brown all over then remove and place into a casserole pot, pour over the liquor and cover the pot with a lid or tin foil. Bake at 150 0c for approx 4 hrs until tender. Leave to cool in the liquor. Drain the cheeks through a colander keeping the liquor. Place the liquor into a pan and reduce until sauce consistency. Put the cheeks into a bowl (discard the veg) and squish with your hands to break up and remove any connective tissue. When the liquor is a sauce add a bit back to moisten, season and reserve.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Cannelloni</strong></p> 
<p>Cut the pasta into appox 5x6cm rectangles. Have a pan of boiling salted water and a bowl of iced water ready. Drop the pasta sheets into the boiling water for 30 seconds and then submerge straight into the ice water. Remove and pat dry with a towel. Lay out a piece of cling film and brush with oil. Lay the past onto this and then brush the top side with a little egg, spoon your cheek mix onto this and roll in the pasta into a cylinder then wrap tightly in the cling film and tie both ends. Warm through in simmering water when needed.</p> 
<p><strong>Parsnip puree</strong></p> 
<p>250g peeled chopped parsnips<br> 50g Unsalted Butter<br> 10g Malt Extract<br> Place all into a heavy bottomed pan and just cover with water and add a good pinch of salt. Boil rapidly until the water evaporates and the butter emulsifies. Place all into a blender and blend adding a little water if needed (the puree should be turning smoothly but not a soup!) season and then pass through a fine sieve.<br> Licorice Puree<br> 100g licorice unsweetened (ie.Panda brands)<br> water<br> Place both into pan and boil, when the licorice is soft transfer to a blender adding the cooking liquor back to make a smooth paste.<br> Licorice Froth<br> 250ml Beef Braising Liquor<br> 1 tbsp of the licorice puree<br> 500ml Milk<br> 4g Lechithin<br> Place all into a tall narrow saucepan and leave for about 30 mins for the lechithin to soak. Then warm on the stove (do not boil) and froth with a stick blender.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Braised Lentils</strong></p> 
<p>100g dried Puy lentils soaked overnight in water<br> 1 carrot<br> 1 Onion<br> 1 Stick Celery<br> 2 Clove Garlic<br> 50g Butter<br> 500ml Chicken stock<br> sprig of Bay and Thyme<br> Drain and rinse the lentils after soaking and place into a pan. Add the chicken stock and water if needed to cover. Take half the onion, 1 clove garlic and the herbs and wrap in a cloth and tie and place this into the lentils. Simmer the lentils gently until tender approx 20 mins. Leave them in the liquor to cool slightly. Finely dice all the vegetables and remaining garlic and sweat this off in a pan with the butter until tender. Drain the lentils but keep the liquor, discard the herb bag. Add the lentils to the vegetables. Reduce the cooking liquor until coating consistency and add back to the lentils, season and reserve.</p> 
<p><strong>Pasta</strong></p> 
<p>5 Egg Yolks<br> 2 Eggs<br> 2Tbsp Olive Oil<br> 2Tbsp Water<br> 1 Sachet of Saffron Powder or A Pinch of Saffron<br> 2 Pinches Salt<br> 500g Pasta Flour<br> Take a bowl and half fill with ice cubes and then place another bowl on top.<br> Place the water and the saffron into a pan and boil until it has nearly evaporated then add the olive oil. Whisk and pour into the bowl set above the ice and whisk until emulsified. Then add the eggs and the egg yolks and whisk again. Push this through a fine sieve. <br> Place half of the flour into the food processor with half the salt and start it turning. Slowly add the egg mix little by little stopping the machine regularly and scraping the sides and bottom of the machine with a spatula. When the dough resembles little beads take a little of the dough and squeeze between your fingers as thin as you can, if the dough has a smooth edge but does not stick to your fingers then it is right, if it is jagged then it is too dry and requires a little more of the egg mix. When the dough is ready remove from the machine and knead until it comes together and then wrap tightly in cling film and rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Repeat with the second batch of flour.<br> When rolling the pasta start at the widest setting and work through the machine and repeat reducing the width of the machine each time when you get to the last setting fold the pasta back into a block and repeat. Lay the sheets in between cling film ready to use.</p> 
<p><strong>To Serve</strong><br> Smear the parsnip puree into the middle of a plate in a circle spoon the warmed Lentils into the middle of the puree. Dot the licorice puree around. Gently remove the cannelloni from the cling film with scissors and lay this on top, garnish with a few parsnip crisps, watercress sprigs and re-blend the froth and spoon a little around. Enjoy!</p>]]></body>

        <title>Mentors Wanted 16-Jul-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, July 16, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Do you, or does somebody you know, have time to help an&nbsp;agriculture trainee become a successful New Zealand farmer?</p> 
<p>AgITO has begun a nationwide initiative to train volunteer mentors to help&nbsp;agriculture trainees complete their qualifications.&nbsp;Many trainees struggle to complete their training for a host of reasons – some&nbsp;have literacy and/or numeracy issues and many have mindset and confidence&nbsp;issues, especially if they did not do well in a school setting.<br> To be a mentor you don’t need to be a grammar or mathematics expert, the most&nbsp;important skill is empathy and the most important contribution you make is your&nbsp;time. The mentoring process works best when the mentor and mentee meet&nbsp;regularly – about an hour a week.</p> 
<p>They’ll train you to do the best job you can – volunteer mentors attend a two day course run by AgITO, usually over a weekend. Once trained, mentors have any costs involved in being a mentor reimbursed.</p> 
<p>If you’re keen to be involved or find out more, please contact :</p>

<p>Included among the guests were the Minister of Women's Affairs Hon. Jo Goodhew, senior police inspector Morris Cheer, Land and Water Forum chairman Alistair Bisley, Freedom Camping Forum chair Geoff Ensor, and Government and community relations manager Peter Fa'afiu of New Zealand Post.</p> 
<p>We decided to make best use of this networking opportunity by including a 'speed dating' event. Several national councillors and staff gave three minute informative presentations on some of our key projects and policy campaigns. There were many questions and comments afterwards and guests said it really helped them appreciate the broad nature of our organisation and depth of our advocacy and charitable activity.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Topics covered included our Canterbury fundraiser - Aftersocks; RWNZ's response to the PSA outbreak in Bay of Plenty (community action); RWNZ on the world stage (attending U.N. CEDAW and supporting ACWW); Pets as Pawns (RWNZ as social change agents); School bus safety and making better use of disused rural school buildings; 'Caring Counts' and RWNZ's 70 year campaign for fair travel costs reimbursement for rural home support workers.</p> 
<p>It was 21 minutes very well spent!<br> <br> Kind regards,<br> Liz </p>]]></body>

        <title>Primary Production Boom</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 01, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry for Primary Industries’ (MPI) new combined primary industry statistics for the March 2012 quarter (with data from the seafood sector now included) show that the sector accounted for 71% of all NZ merchandise exports in the year to March 2012.</p> 
<p>Reasons were: better-than-usual pasture growth during the March 2012 quarter, resulting in near-record carcase weights for slaughtered livestock and an 11.5% increase in milk solids’ production, compared with the same quarter in 2011. However, the increased production was counterbalanced by a stronger NZ dollar and easing international dairy prices. The result was that overall primary sector export revenue for the quarter was down 2.4% on the previous year (to $8.3 billion). However, total export earnings for the year to March 2012 were up 6.2% on the previous year at $32.3 billion.</p> 
<div> 
 <p>Total seafood export earnings were up by 9.4% in the March quarter. Forest product export revenue declined 14%, but it was still the second-highest quarter for forest products on record. </p>

<p>To celebrate the great service our rural delivery contractors provide, Rural Women New Zealand is launching a Postman pat-on-the-back Award.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“There are some heart-warming stories out there about posties who go above and beyond to make sure the mail gets through,” says RWNZ national president, Liz Evans.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“We’ve heard of posties who find the right home for mail addressed only with first names, who telephone first before delivering large parcels or who leave sweet treats in letterboxes.”</p> 
<p>And in a crisis the rural delivery contractors can be a lifeline. During floods, when bridges have been washed away, rural posties have been known to deliver supplies by boat to people whose road access is cut off.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To share your special story about your rural delivery contractor, go to the Rural Women New Zealand page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ruralwomennz">Facebook</a>. Entries close on Friday 31 August.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The top 10 stories will be published on Facebook, with prizes for the winners and their postie.<br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ruralwomennz">www.facebook.com/ruralwomennz</a> </p>]]></body>

        <title>NZ Guild of Agricultural Journalists Awards 2012 06-Aug-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, August 06, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Entries are now open for the Rural Women New Zealand Journalism Award 2012, which will be presented at the NZ Guild of Agricultural Journalists Awards in Wellington on 12 October.</p> 
<p>Rural Women NZ began sponsoring the prize five years ago to encourage journalists to redress a serious gender imbalance in the rural media, and turn their attention to the achievements of women living and working in rural communities.</p> 
<p>It’s a strategy that’s paid off, says RWNZ national president, Liz Evans.</p> 
<p>“At last year’s awards, there were more entries in the Rural Women New Zealand Journalism Award category than any other, reflecting much more balanced reporting in the rural media.”</p> 
<p>There’s also been a growth in the number of women working as rural reporters.</p> 
<p>One iconic rural television show has brought in five new freelance reporters and directors in the last seven years, and four of these have been women. The producer describes the women as very experienced, talented and able.</p> 
<p>“We’re delighted to see on that show alone that half of its recent episodes were made by women reporters and directors, and several had women as the main subject,” says Liz Evans.</p> 
<p>Last year’s winner of the Rural Women New Zealand Journalism Award was Rebecca Harper, who’s since gone on to become news editor of a major farming weekly newspaper.</p> 
<p>Entries in the RWNZ Journalism Award 2012 must be of two articles, radio broadcasts or television programmes based on the theme of ‘rural women making a difference’.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“This could be in the sense of community involvement, on farm, or in another rural-based business or activity.”</p> 
<p>Entries close Monday 10 September 2012. Any New Zealand-based journalist or communicator is eligible to enter the award. The winner will receive $500.</p>

<p>Rural Women New Zealand was asked to talk to the group, along with Dairy Women’s Network. <br> National councillor Shirley Read and Janet Williams of Rukuhia branch (above centre) gave a presentation, and the women were very interested to hear about Access Homehealth, our school bus safety campaign, and breast cancer advocacy.</p> 
<p>Tony and Semi Kim from New Organisation Vision organised the educational tour, with Tony translating Shirley Read’s presentation as she spoke.</p> 
<p>Janet Williams says, “The ladies were very moved on the school bus issue, but the Let’s Get Plastered for Breast Cancer Campaign was a challenge for Tony to translate, so his wife Semi did that one!”</p>]]></body>

        <title>Turning the tide for a rural school 14-Aug-2012</title>
        <date>Tuesday, August 14, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Michelle Cameron was an inspiring speaker at our Lower North Island Regional Conference, talking about how she and the community turned around the fortunes of James Cook School in Marton and presided over impressive roll growth from 71 students in 2008 to 170 today.</p> 
<p>We invited her to share her story on the introduction of the R.I.C.H.E.R. values that have been part of the school’s core culture since 2009. These are based on respect, inclusion, co-operation, honesty, endeavour and resolution.</p> 
<p>She says, “some may ask what James Cook School and Rural Women NZ have in common? On the surface very little. However your vision of ‘Growing Dynamic Communities’ connects to who we are. A vision to build dynamic communities of leaders who will stand for what is right and have the skill to lead us into the future. The endeavour to be the best that we can be and the passionate resolve to see things through.”</p> 
<p>James Cook is a multi-cultural, semi-rural school located in the Rangitikei town of Marton. It is a school with strong foundations and a passionate parent community and staff who, in earlier times, were willing to fight for the right to stay open when pending closure was looming.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“In 2008 I had the privilege of accepting the principal’s position. Spending time with students, staff and community members to hear their aspirations was vital in the first few months. Our community wanted their children to stand tall, value themselves and others and lead by example. The school’s long standing mission statement of ‘Achieving excellence through aroha, endeavour and resolution’ needed to be lived. We needed to pull together for this to happen.”</p> 
<p>In 2008 the school’s vision became ‘Building an interdependent community of engaged learners who go forth to influence the world round them’.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To ensure the vision was more than words on a piece of paper more courageous conversations were had.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“We had to agree on what core values we were going to stand for. Time debating why each core belief was important in the past, in the present and in the future was valuable.”</p> 
<p>Our vision is now our reality. We are an interdependent community of engaged learners who go forth and influence the world around us in a R.I.C.H.E.R way. Our mission statement is alive and well. We have high community engagement. Our Board of Trustees and staff are committed to continued improvement and we have a growing roll.</p>]]></body>

        <title>RWNZ calls for action on homecare injustices 14-Aug-2012</title>
        <date>Tuesday, August 14, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Caring-counts-cover-2.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Caring-counts-cover-2.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 99px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Rural Women NZ says the Government doesn’t appreciate the crisis now facing NGOs working in the home-based older persons sector, and we’re calling for action, now.</p> 
<p>The impacts of Government policies were highlighted in a recent report by the Human Rights Commission <a href="http://www.hrc.co.nz/eeo/caring-counts-report-of-the-inquiry-into-the-aged-care-workforce">‘Caring Counts’</a>, after its inquiry into the aged care workforce.</p> 
<p>At our national conference, delegates passed two remits calling for a fair deal for homecare workers and NGO homecare providers.</p> 
<div> 
 <div> 
  <div> 
   <div>
    <strong> <p>TRAVEL AND INFLATION COSTS</p> </strong>
   </div> 
   <p>We urged the Government to reimburse workers’ travel at the IRD mileage rates for business use of a vehicle; and secondly to hold DHBs accountable for ensuring that all funds received for homecare services, including inflation adjustments and travel expenses for care workers, are passed on to service providers in a timely fashion, as intended by Government.</p> 
   <p>NGOs are struggling as the Government increases the minimum wage and employer contributions to Kiwisaver, and yet provides no additional funding to meet these new costs. <br> DHBs also fail to pass on inflation increases. Some have not passed on an inflation increase for three years.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>NGOs have strived for many years to gain meaningful dialogue with government in an attempt to address these injustices, with little success.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>The Human Rights Commission says fixing the problem of pay inequalities between those employed by DHBs directly, and those employed by NGOs would cost approximately $140 million a year, and it recommends a stepped approach to implement fairness on pay rates over three years.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>It says the costs of pay parity would be offset by savings in recruitment costs, given the current high turnover of carers, and a reduction in hospital admissions through improved care of older people in the community.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>RWNZ says it’s not acceptable for Ministers to say, once again, that the issues will be addressed when the country’s accounts are in a stronger financial position, while some DHBs continue to exploit the NGO sector and its workforce.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div>
    <strong> <p>WHAT CAN YOU DO TO SUPPORT ACCESS?</p> </strong>
   </div> 
   <p>Let people know that if a person is entitled to homecare support on discharge from hospital, they should ensure they have a care plan in place before they go home.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Spread the word that people leaving hospital are entitled to a choice of homecare provider; it is not up to the hospital to decide.</p> 
   <p>Request Access brochures to distribute in your community, e.g. doctors’ surgeries, Grey Power groups.</p>

<p>Mai – a prominent constitutional lawyer - spoke about the book, which looks inside the New Zealand system of government and tells people in detail how it works, without jargon and complex language. The book is a great resource for any organisation that needs to deal with our policy and decision makers.</p> 
<p>Over 40 people attended the evening in our Wellington boardroom, and it was also an opportunity to promote our latest cookbook, A Good Harvest, with tastings of relishes, pickles and chutneys to go with a wonderful variety of cheeses.</p>]]></body>

<p>Sadly, in recent weeks more than one young person has died as a direct or indirect result of drug or alcohol use, and a number of others have been harmed.<br> Red Cross has introduced a programme called SAM – Save A Mate – to address the harm and try to reduce and avoid it.</p> 
<p>Red Cross Area Manager Adrienne Transom spoke to the Tutaenui branch in June about the programme, and what it involves.</p> 
<p>The focus is not on “just saying no”, but acknowledges that young people will experiment, and arms them with the information they may need to save a mate’s life, and to make more informed decisions for themselves.</p> 
<p>The programme is run by trained facilitators through high schools. One school in the Rangitikei area has already signed up to put all its students through the programme this year, and to run follow-up sessions in future years for new students. Adrienne hopes other schools in the area will also take up the programme.</p> 
<p>SAM looks at what the effects of alcohol and drugs really are, risk factors around abuse and overdose, and symptoms of and best response to an overdose (basic first aid).</p> 
<p>“A lot of students just don’t know what the effects are,” Transom said. “When we tell them how long alcohol or marijuana stays in their system, they’re often shocked.”</p> 
<p>SAM is an interactive workshop, and teachers are asked not to attend, to allow young people to talk openly and honestly about their own experiences. There’s no charge for schools. The only commitment they need to make is a few hours of students’ time.</p>

It’s updated seasonally and currently has over 160 recipes to choose from.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The app also has handy things like a shopping list which you can send on to someone else; you can share what you’re cooking via social media; and you can mark your favourite recipes for easy access. It was recently #1 in Apple’s iTunes store Food and Drink category.</p> 
<p>The recipes aim to give people using the app new ideas with familiar ingredients, as well as the inspiration to try some new things out. You can choose what you’re making based on a whole range of main ingredients, or based on different cooking styles: “I feel like soup tonight”, for instance.</p> 
<p>The app has the potential to help local food producers too. Food partners pay to be in some of the app’s recipes. For example, in New Zealand Silver Fern Farms, Campbell’s Real Stocks, George Weston Foods, the Seafood Industry Council, Hansells, and Rangitikei Corn Fed Free Range Chickens are all partners with <span style="line-height: 20.981481552124px; font-size: 13px;">Fast, Fresh &amp; Tasty</span>.</p> 
<p>The app developers say that for local artisan producers, <span style="line-height: 20.981481552124px; font-size: 13px;">Fast, Fresh &amp; Tasty</span>&nbsp;is an opportunity for them to get exposure to new consumers at a lower cost than compared to making an app themselves, or even other forms of advertising.</p> 
<p>“Fast Fresh &amp; Tasty” is a Universal app; optimised for both the iPhone and iPad. It costs $5.29 to download from the Apple store.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Good Homes for Good Lives 16-Aug-2012</title>
        <date>Thursday, August 16, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>We all want a positive experience of ageing, to be valued and to live in the places we feel connected to.&nbsp;Good Homes for Good Lives focuses on helping older people keep up with repairs and maintenance so they can stay in their own homes and communities for longer.</p> 
<p>Their research found that older people often put off repairs because they feel it’s too hard and would cost too much. But there is a greater cost – their health suffers if the house is cold, uncomfortable or unsafe.</p> 
<p>They've transformed their findings into practical action: three check-list tools that help people identify what work needs to be done and who is the best person to do it.</p> 
<p>You can find out more about Good Homes for Good Lives and the FREE&nbsp;check-list&nbsp;tools on their website <a href="http://www.goodhomes.co.nz/">www.goodhomes.co.nz&nbsp;</a></p>

        <title>Calling for a rural focus in medical Voluntary Bonding Scheme review 16-Aug-2012</title>
        <date>Thursday, August 16, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women New Zealand is calling for more transparency around the number of doctors, midwives and nursing graduates working in rural communities under the Voluntary Bonding Scheme, which gives financial incentives to health professionals who agree to work in hard-to-staff areas.</p> 
<p>"This scheme was offered as a means of attracting health workers to rural communities," says Rural Women New Zealand health spokesperson, Kerry Maw. "However, our request to the Minister of Health under the Official Information Act has revealed that no data is kept on how many of those registered in the scheme actually work in rural areas, as opposed to other hard-to-staff locations."</p> 
<p>The scheme, which has been running for three years, is now under review by Health Minister Tony Ryall, as the first of the graduates become eligible for payouts towards their student loan debts.</p> 
<p>"We are concerned to hear that just 25 doctors, of a potential 105, have had their payments approved so far, and that the numbers of those now applying to join the scheme has fallen significantly," says Mrs Maw.</p> 
<p>A key concern is that the scheme appears to have failed to attract any rural GPs, according to the Rural General Practice Network, despite over 44 permanent GP vacancies around the country.<br> "Rural primary healthcare services are being supported by international medical graduates, who make up 57 percent of the rural GP workforce, instead of encouraging our local graduates to work in rural communities."</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand says the problem is urgent, as the average age of rural GPs is rising, and is now between 50 and 55 years.</p> 
<p>"Rural Women New Zealand fully supports positive incentives for nurses, midwives and doctors to work in the rural sector, and would like to see this as a clear target in the Voluntary Bonding Scheme's review."</p> 
<p>"The impacts, both socially and financially, are huge when rural hospitals and communities have to rely on a series of locums, potentially putting health outcomes for clients at risk. On the other hand, there are very tangible benefits to attracting a strong, stable workforce to these communities."<br> <br> <br> For further information please contact: <br> Kerry Maw <br> Health spokesperson, <br> Rural Women New Zealand<br> Email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="68030d1a1a114605091f281a1d1a09041f07050d0646071a0f460612">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>]]></body>

        <title>Call to vaccinate working dogs for lepto 21-Aug-2012</title>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 18.75pt; background-color: white;">Leptospirosis is a severe and sometimes fatal disease in dogs. Dogs may also have no symptoms, but can be a source of infection for humans and other animals.</p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 18.75pt; background-color: white;">The Massey study sampled 655 dogs, which were screened for four Leptospirosis strains: Copenhageni, Pomona, Harjo and Ballum. 10.3% of all types of dogs tested positive to serovar Copenhageni, while serovar Harjo was predominantly found in breeds of dogs used as farm working dogs.</p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 18.75pt; background-color: white;">The full scientific article ‘A Serological Survey of Leptospiral Antibodies in Dogs in New Zealand” AL Harland, NJ Cave, BR Jones, J Benschop, JJ Donald, AC Midwinter, RA Squires &amp; JM Collins-Emerson, was published in the New Zealand Veterinary Journal – 8 August 2012, and can be purchased by going to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tnzv20">www.tandfonline.com/loi/tnzv20</a></p>]]></body>

        <title>TV White Space Technology offers new hope for rural broadband 04-Sep-2012</title>
        <date>Tuesday, September 04, 2012</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p style="background-color: white;">A report on the use of new ‘white space’ technology, which has the potential to provide inexpensive, high-speed broadband for remote areas, has been welcomed by Rural Women New Zealand as a possible solution for consumers unable to benefit from the Rural Broadband Initiative.</p> 
<p style="background-color: white;">The<a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=105503"> TV White Space Technology for Rural Communications report</a> was written by independent Wellington-based telecommunications consultant, Jon Brewer, funded by InternetNZ through its Community Projects Fund.<br> “Rural Women New Zealand has strongly advocated for more to be done to level the playing field for people who live in areas where the terrain or remote location means that the only option is satellite broadband, which comes at a significant cost and is affected by weather conditions,” says Liz Evans, Rural Women NZ’s national president.<br> “This report suggests that using available television spectrum could offer a low cost, effective broadband alternative for rural areas, and one that, we understand, would not be affected by weather conditions and trees.<br> “We would encourage our policymakers and telecos to investigate how television white space might be incorporated into our wireless technology to help bridge the digital divide for those who are going to be left out in the cold by the RBI.”</p>]]></body>

        <img>/images/blog/Postman pat on the back winner Dianne Howe.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Postman pat on the back winner Dianne Howe.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 270px; height: 173px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Hokitika’s Diane Howe is the very deserving winner of our Postman pat-on-the-back Award, pictured here with one of two people who put her name forward, Anne van Beek.</p> 
<p>As NZ Post considers the future face of its mail service – both urban and rural – we launched our Postman pat-on-the-back Award to celebrate our rural posties and the wonderful service they provide to rural and remote communities</p> 
<p>We received many heart-warming entries about posties who ‘go the extra mile’ for their customers. Many of you felt so moved by all the extra help and kindness your postie brings, you turned to poetry to express yourselves.</p> 
<p>Out of 22 entries, we’re delighted to announce the winner of our Postman pat-on-the-back Award is Diane Howe of Hokitika, who was nominated separately by Anne van Beek and Di Strang.</p> 
<p>Diane Howe fell into the role of postie, RD2 Hokitika, after her husband Bernie died following an accident delivering mail in the area. Diane didn’t want to let his customers down, so took on the run herself. That was 12 years ago and she now travels 52,000 kilometres a year and has 499 clients.<br> Diane’s help has been legendary, says Anne van Beek. “It’s never a problem to deliver medicine, packages or whatever may have been urgently requested.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Di Strang agrees. “She’s a character and has one of the most generous natures I have ever seen.” Di says Diane Howe’s friendly face at the mailbox helped her overcome loneliness when she moved to the area nine years ago. Since then Diane’s given gifts to each new baby that’s come along as well as older siblings, and at Easter all the children get a treat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After the Christchurch earthquakes Diane packaged up 17 boxes of lego she had at home, and with Di’s help, sent them to children who’d faced loss.</p> 
<p>Diane reports road problems to the council, along with suggested solutions. If children are seen waiting for the mail, Diane explains where they should wait so they are not in danger.</p> 
<p>Anne says Diane’s been a godsend. “Reliable affable and always ready to go the extra mile, to help out wherever she can.”</p> 
<p>Congratulations to Diane and all the other posties you wrote to us about.</p>

        <title>Winner of Rural Women NZ Journalism Award 15-Oct-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, October 15, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Jackie Harrigan and Liz Evans.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Jackie Harrigan and Liz Evans.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left;">Shining a spotlight on women living and working in rural areas has seen two journalists from the NZX Agri group take out the Rural Women New Zealand Journalism Award 2012.</p> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 The Rural Women New Zealand Award recognises journalism that portrays the important contribution women make to farm businesses and in rural communities. &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 This year’s winner was Jackie Harrigan for articles that appeared in Country-Wide magazine, while Andrew Stewart of Young Country was runner up.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Their success was celebrated at the New Zealand Guild of Agricultural Journalists’ Awards dinner in Wellington on Friday evening.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 In presenting the award, Rural Women NZ national president, Liz Evans, said the winning entries were refreshing, informative and topical and reflected the true professionalism of the farming women whose stories they told.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 One story, for example, involved school leaver Anita, who finally got her dream job as a shepherd on a North Island hill country station, only to experience a quad bike accident that left her in a wheelchair. But Anita’s fighting spirit has ensured that she is still pursuing a career in agriculture.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 A total of ten awards were presented, nine for journalism and one for photography.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Liz Evans said, “Rural Women New Zealand continues to support these awards as we see the calibre and content of the entries about rural women, their lives, businesses and communities grow more dynamic each time.”
</div>

        <title>A lovely new car for Rainbow Place 15-Oct-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, October 15, 2012</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/DSC_0325_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 0px solid;" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/DSC_0325_New.jpg">To celebrate the International Day of Rural Women on 15 October, we presented&nbsp;a second car to Rainbow Place, which will be used by its nurses and therapists to travel to families coping with grief and loss due to serious illness or the death of a loved one.</p> 
<p>“We presented the first car to Rainbow Place this time&nbsp;last year, thanks to fundraising by Rural Women and a generous bequest from one of our treasured members, Chica Gilmer,” says Rukuhia branch spokesperson, Janet Williams.</p> 
<p>Now Chica Gilmer’s estate has made available further funds to present a second car to Rainbow Place, the children and young people’s service of Hospice Waikato.</p> 
<p>“Children expecting a visit from a Rainbow Place nurse or therapist can look forward to seeing the cheeky bright red cars, sporting the number plates ‘Chica’ and ‘Gilmer’,” says Janet Williams.</p> 
<p>The second car will also mean shorter waiting times for families to see a therapist or nurse, who travel hundreds of kilometers each month throughout the Waikato, King Country,Thames and Coromandel, supporting children and young people.</p> 
<p>Both cars have been supplied at by Jim Wright Nissan, who has come up with a generous deal on the new Nissan Micra vehicles.</p> 
<p>Penny Parsons, Manager of Rainbow Place, says “The Rainbow Place team are so grateful. We just want to say a huge thank you, not only on behalf of the staff, but also on behalf of the children, young people and their families who we now visit, and those we will be visiting in the future. It is the support of our local community that enables us to carry on doing our work with children young people and their families going through ‘tough stuff’.”</p> 
<p>Pictured here are Janet Williams and Jim Wright of Jim Wright Nissan who supplied the car.</p>]]></body>

        <title>White paper good news for vulnerable children 15-Oct-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, October 15, 2012</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/White paper for vulnerable children.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="border: 0px solid; vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/White paper for vulnerable children.jpg">Rural Women New Zealand welcomes the White Paper for Vulnerable Children, seeing it as a sincere and thorough examination of the situation for children in this country.</p> 
<p> </p> The ambulance is moving nearer to the top of the cliff, says Rural Women NZ spokesperson, Pam Thomlinson, “but we still have some way to go, especially to address the specific issues surrounding rural children. The rural perspective still needs to be acknowledged&nbsp; and reflected in the new strategies and in particular there needs to be sufficient funding so that rural communities have the same access to services as urban people, such as post-natal and ante-natal care and school support. 
<p>On the plus side, we applaud the more co-ordinated approach to protecting vulnerable children, the Child Protect phone line, more training for professionals and local multi-disciplinary children’s teams.</p> 
<p>Involving the local community is also very important, especially in rural areas where people can be isolated and abuse hidden.</p> 
<p>Vulnerable children can be living in families that are quite transient, so the requirement for different agencies to work more closely together, and the web-based national database on vulnerable children, are also positive moves.</p>

        <title>Bay of Plenty Mystery Bus Tour of women's rural enterprises inspires 19-Oct-2012</title>
        <date>Friday, October 19, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Diane Coleman region 5 international day of RW.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="width: 400px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; height: 322px; margin-right: 10px; border: 0px solid;" src="/images/blog/Diane Coleman region 5 international day of RW.jpg">“Monday 15 October - the International Day of Rural Women - dawned bright and sunny as we set off from our homes throughout the Bay of Plenty to gather at the Kaharoa Hall for our Mystery Bus Trip of rural enterprises run by local women,” writes Mary McTavish.</p> 
<p>“We were greeted by our National Councillor Wendy McGowan and introduced to Lachlan McKenzie another local resident.</p> 
<p>Lachlan is a mine of scientific and geological information about the state of the Rotorua Lakes catchment area. He outlined all the nutrients - both good and bad - that are finding their way into the lakes through various means, man-made and naturally, and what steps the local farmers are taking to minimize the impact these nutrients are having on the welfare of the lakes.</p> 
<p>Then it was time for the mystery tour, and we discovered that we had the “kiddies bus” for the day!&nbsp; The entire inside of the bus had been handpainted with the most intricate and detailed characters from fairy stories which were most interesting to decipher as we drove along during the day.</p> 
<p>Our first stop was at Chris and Jamie Paterson’s farm where we viewed their new settling pond.&nbsp; This lined pond receives all the effluent from the cowshed which collects the solids and allows evaporation to take place before the liquids are pumped out.&nbsp; Chris and Jamie have done extensive planting around the perimeter of the pond which will act as screening when the plants grow.</p> 
<p>From there we travelled only a short distance to visit Treeline Native Nursery which is run by another enterprising young couple Diane and John Coleman.</p> 
<p>Diane noticed a gap in the native plant market some seventeen years ago and set herself up in a much smaller way than the impressive operation it is today. A band of busy ladies were pricking out minute seedlings into hundreds of small pots ready for next season.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Diane keeps her costs down by doing a lot of her own propagating and, now that they have a truck, can offer competitive freight rates for orders of over a thousand or more trees.&nbsp; Large scale plantings have been their life blood for many years with work for the local regional and local councils, but more recently this has become harder as more companies are now in this sector and competition fiercer.</p> 
<p>We had a tour around the full operation and spoke to Diane’s friendly staff getting a few tips for our own domestic plantings along the way.</p> 
<p>Mamaku Blue was our lunch stop where we sampled the blueberry treats that were on offer in the shop where all the products for sale had either a gooseberry or blueberry content.&nbsp; From juices to jams, liqueurs to lollies and even blueberry bones (dog biscuits), these folk had got something for everyone.</p> 
<p>Joanna White and her Handmade New Zealand Lavender Farm was the penultimate stop on this trip of visiting rural women in their rural enterprises.</p> 
<p>This is Joanna’s second lavender farm and having been on the site only five years from bare land she has done a wonderful job.&nbsp; A rustic shop and cottage garden aspect were most enticing and not many folk on the bus got back on after that stop without a purchase in their hands.</p> 
<p>Wendy had one final treat in store for us as she has a neighbour who is a “gardenaholic” -Carol Shaw. Carol and her husband Paul have created a showpiece rural garden mixing new plantings amongst some old gnarled trees with mass underplantings of hostas and clivias. The garden is a credit to Carol’s hard graft and Paul’s willingness&nbsp; to do the heavy jobs.</p> 
<p>The Shaws are taking part in the Rotorua Open Gardens Ramble in a couple of weeks and their garden will be fully in bloom by then.</p> 
<p>A beautiful ending to a great day."</p>

        <title>Congratulations to Lisa Harper, Nuffield NZ Scholar 2012 12-Nov-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, November 12, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/Lisa Harper and Nuffield Scholars_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<div>
 <img src="/images/Lisa Harper and Nuffield Scholars_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 127px; float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 4px;" alt="Lisa Harper Nuffield Scholar">
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Rural Women New Zealand congratulates Lisa Harper on being awarded a prestigious Nuffield Farming Scholarship for 2013.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Lisa and her Marlborough Sounds cheesemaking and accommodation business won the Enterprising Rural Women Award 2011, a win that Lisa says changed her life and eventually led to her applying for the Nuffield.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Lisa says, “Not only did [the Enterprising Rural Women Award] provide me with a boost in confidence at the time, but it led on to things that I would once have never thought possible.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Rural Women New Zealand national president, Liz Evans, says “When we set up the Enterprising Rural Women Awards four years ago, our goal was to identify and celebrate &nbsp;women running &nbsp;successful businesses in rural communities. &nbsp;So being part of Lisa’s journey towards becoming a Nuffield scholar is very rewarding for our organisation as well.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 As a first step on that journey, Lisa received an offer to do a Masters in Business Management through Massey University, which she completed in July – as well as working seven days a week in her business.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Her Masters thesis looked at rural entrepreneurship, the outcome of which, she says, blew conventional wisdom out of the water about barriers to innovation in rural communities. &nbsp;Instead she found her Marlborough study subjects incredibly innovative, globally networked and actively pioneering new industries.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Her Nuffield research will flow on from her Masters, focusing on encouraging innovation in rural businesses.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Lisa already has a PhD in plant pathology from Lincoln University and a science degree from Victoria University.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 The Nuffield Scholarship will mean Lisa will travel for much of next year. &nbsp;She’ll take part in a Contemporary Scholars conference with 60 Nuffield Scholars from around the world and a six-week Global Focus Programme through several countries with other scholars.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br>

        <title>Dunedin invitation to hear Dr Judy McGregor speak on aged care injustices 16-Nov-2012</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/caring-counts_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left;"> Dr Judy McGregor, Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner with the Human Rights Commission, will be speaking on worker discrimination in the aged care sector at a breakfast meeting in Dunedin on 30 November, and members of the public are warmly invited to come along. </p> 
<p> Earlier this year, Dr McGregor worked ‘under cover’ as a trainee carer in a residential aged care facility to gain insight into the many aspects of aged care.<br> The result was her in-depth report “<a href="http://www.hrc.co.nz/eeo/caring-counts-report-of-the-inquiry-into-the-aged-care-workforce">Caring Counts</a>”, which is a call to action over the injustices and inequalities faced by workers in the aged care sector.<br> She says, “The value we place on older people in New Zealand is linked to the value we place on those who care for them. <br> “The sense of crisis that surrounds aged care is partly a reflection of our collective knowledge that we are not being fair and that a large group of workers is being discriminated against. <br> “Inaction on pay equality and inadequate compensation are breaches of fundamental human rights. Given their significance, these breaches cannot be justified by affordability arguments.”<br> Dr McGregor will be speaking in the William Cargill Room, Cargills Hotel, George Street, Dunedin at 7.45am on Friday 30 November.<br> Rural Women NZ national councillor, Margaret Pittaway, says “This is a wonderful opportunity to hear Dr McGregor speak, and all are welcome.”<br> Coffee and muffins will be served and there is no entry charge.<br> Enquiries to Margaret Pittaway, National Councillor, Rural Women New Zealand.&nbsp; Email:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d6bbb7a4b1b7a4b3a2f8a6bfa2a2b7a1b7af96a4a3a4b7baa1b9bbb3b8f8b9a4b1f8b8ac"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="036e627164627166772d736a77776274627a43717671626f746c6e666d2d6c71642d6d79">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or call (03) 445 1201.&nbsp; </p>]]></body>

RWNZ member, Justine Ottey, the originator of our Canterbury earthquake Aftersocks™ fundraiser, joined a select group at Government House for afternoon tea with the Duchess of Cornwall.</p> 
<br> Rural Women New Zealand had sent two pairs of Aftersocks™ to Government House to give to the Royal couple.
<br> &nbsp;
<br> Justine Ottey said, “Prince Charles is well known as a champion of the wool industry, so it was great to be able to tell the Duchess that the socks were made from New Zealand merino wool.”&nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;
<br> This is an exciting culmination to the Aftersocks™ journey. &nbsp;RWNZ national president, Liz Evans, said “Our socks have received national and international acclaim and now they will be warming Royal feet.”
<br> &nbsp;
<br> The project will close 31 December with a limited numbers of socks still available.

        <title>Garden grants give little green fingers a boost 05-Dec-2012</title>

        <img>/images/blog/Tinui School.JPG</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Tinui School.JPG" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Children at six North Island rural schools will be encouraged to get their hands dirty as they develop vegetable gardens and orchards after being selected as the lucky winners of $2000 gardening grants.</p> 
<br> Rural Women New Zealand and Farmlands will present the cheques to the schools over the coming week.
<br> 
<br> National president, Liz Evans, says “This is the third time that Rural Women New Zealand and Farmlands have collaborated to distribute the proceeds of the popular Farmlands Ladies Nights, which are held around the North Island during October.
<br> 
<br> “The resurgence of interest in eating fresh food and getting back to basics was reflected in the number of applications we received, with 113 rural primary schools applying for grants.”
<br> 
<br> The money will be used to buy equipment, seedlings or plants to start a vegetable garden or orchard, or further develop one already in place.
<br> 
<br> The schools will also receive gardening equipment from McGregor’s Gardening, a gardening starter kit from Yates, fertiliser from Agrisea NZ Ltd and a copy of ‘A Good Harvest – recipes from the gardens of Rural Women New Zealand’ so the children can put all their produce to good use. 
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>
<br> 
<br> The successful schools are:
<br> 
<br> Ohuka School, Wairoa&nbsp;
<br> 
<p> <a href="http://www.times-age.co.nz/news/pupils-grow-garden-skills/1646439/">Tinui School, Wairarapa</a></p> Toko School, Stratford&nbsp;

        <title>Family Violence? It's OK to Ask for Help 05-Dec-2012</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/ITSOKto ask for help logo web_New.jpg" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; width: 150px; height: 105px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><br> The present dry conditions affecting the country will be putting an added strain on many families. Rural Women New Zealand is organising drought events to bring people together to support each other at this time. &nbsp;Funding support for such events may be available by contact Rural Women NZ's national office - (04) 473 5524.</p> 
<p>If you need specific help in the case of breakdown in family relationships and violence, it's good to be aware of the It's OK to Ask for Help campaign.</p> 
<p><span style="line-height: 21px; color: #444444;">Often people want help from friends, family and neighbours. What you do and say can make a difference to someone’s life.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p> Violence is not just physical. Some common signs that one person is controlling and intimidating another are:<br> <br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>constant criticising<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>texting and or calling to check up<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>telling someone what to do, wear, and say<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>pressure to have sex<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>controlling finances<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>harming animals.<br> <br> <strong>How can you help?</strong><br> Listen to your intuition. &nbsp;If you feel something’s not right, here are some things to say:<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Are you ok?<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I’m worried about the way your partner checks up on you all the time<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>If you ever need to talk about anything, I’m available&nbsp;<br> <br> It takes a lot of courage for someone who is in a violent or controlling relationship to tell someone about it. &nbsp;<br> <br> If a victim tells you, it’s important to listen and take it seriously. &nbsp;If someone talks to you about wanting to hurt or control their family, it’s important to challenge the behaviour not the person.&nbsp;<br> <br> Let people know that help is available. Call the family violence information line on 0800 456 450 to find local services. &nbsp;<br> <br> Never put your own safety at risk. &nbsp;If a situation is dangerous and someone might get hurt, call the Police on 111, even if you’re not sure.<br> <br> For more information go to <a href="www.areyouok.org.nz">www.areyouok.org.nz</a> </p>]]></body>

        <title>Trees on Farms - what to plant and how to find out 10-Dec-2012</title>
        <date>Monday, December 10, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Trees on Farms for website_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p> <img alt="" src="/images/blog/Trees on Farms for website_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 149px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Complete this survey and BE IN TO WIN!</p> 
<p> <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Trees_on_Farms" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit;">www.surveymonkey.com/s/Trees_on_Farms</a></p> 
<p>So … you’ve got a new lifestyle block and want to plant some trees … you’d like to get into a bit of farm forestry … or you want to put in some shade trees or shelter belts on your farm …</p> 
<p> But what to plant? How to look after the trees once their planted? &nbsp;And where to go to find out the best information?</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand is supporting a new project: ‘<strong>Trees on Farms: making better use of information resources</strong>’, which is being funded by the MPI Sustainable Farming Fund, the NZ Farm Forestry Association and Scion Research.</p> 
<p>The first thing the project team would like to know is: &nbsp;What are the best ways of letting people know about planting and managing trees? &nbsp;<br> They’ve put together a short survey, and to encourage you to complete it, will put you in the draw for petrol vouchers, a copy of ‘Native Trees of New Zealand and their story’ by John Wardle, &nbsp;and our own very popular cookbooks ‘A Good Spread’ and ‘A Good Harvest.’<br> Once they know how people would like to receive the information, the project team will turn their focus to putting together a database of the best information sources for planting and managing trees.<br> Leading farm foresters, forestry consultants and researchers are all contributing, to make sure that the database is a storehouse of current knowledge and best practice. &nbsp;Sounds useful …</p> 
<p> Thanks for completing the survey! &nbsp;Here’s the link again: &nbsp;</p>

        <title>New Tunnel House for South Westland Area School 12-Dec-2012</title>
        <date>Wednesday, December 12, 2012</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Cheque presentation to South Westland ARea School_New.jpg</img>

<br> Rural Women New Zealand national councillor, Pam Thomlinson, will present the jumbo-sized cheque on behalf of Meridian at a special ceremony to be held at the school on Tuesday 11 December at 9am. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> South Westland Area School was one of fifty-two hopeful South Island rural primary schools that applied for the two grants on offer. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The other successful application came from Lyttelton Harbour Basin Schools – a grouping of eight schools that collaborate on gardening projects.
<br> 
<br> Rural Women NZ national president, Liz Evans, said “We are pleased to be able to support children in learning where their food comes from, and how easy it is to grow when you have the right equipment and materials.
<br> 
<br> “We are also giving the school a copy of our publication “A Good Harvest – Recipes from the Gardens of Rural Women New Zealand” with tips on growing fruit and vegetables, and lots of great recipes for using the produce once it’s grown.”
<br> 
<br> Meridian is also gifting a copy of the publication to the fifty unsuccessful schools.&nbsp;
<br> 
<br> South Westland Area School currently has several small garden plots that are managed by different class levels throughout the school.
<br> 
<br> However, they struggle with high rainfall, and having to take covers on and off their plots for weeding and planting.
<br> 
<br> The $2,000 gardening grant will be used to buy a tunnel house with irrigation to extend and optimise the growing season.

        <title>The Cry of A Morepork 12-Dec-2012</title>
        <date>Wednesday, December 12, 2012</date>
        <img>/images/blog/The Cry of the Morepork_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/The Cry of the Morepork_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 120px; height: 180px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Cry of A Morepork - Writings of Evelyn Parkes</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Edited by Anne and Leonie Hayden</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Cry of a Morepork is a collection of clippings, letters to editors, essays and observations written by Evelyn Hilda May Parkes over her lifetime; a shy but vibrant farmer’s wife, mother, church goer and community volunteer. Each excerpt was taken from Evelyn’s ‘book’ – a fragile, yellowing old exercise book in which she proudly pasted her clippings – or from her personal journals.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Anne and Leonie Hayden are her daughter and granddaughter, respectively, and with this labour of love they have paid tribute to an unassuming but extraordinary woman.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;This book provides a rare insight into the life of one woman whose life was impacted by the Great Depression, a suppressed mother, a father who was a veteran of WW1, her two daughters and her marriage to a Waikato farmer. Evelyn’s writing, much of which was published in farming periodicals, local papers and the New Zealand Herald, with one piece broadcast on radio, portrays with unsullied honesty and humour her life and development as a writer and observer of life. Implicit in these pages is a story which tells why and how feminism came about and what has been achieved individually and collectively by rural women of New Zealand.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Evelyn’s stories are not grand adventures or fairytales – they are real life and real love and family. They are a peek into a bygone era and the lives of your own parents and grandparents.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“In 1947, during our honeymoon, I visited the Mount for the first time. It was a holiday weekend and we saw many people. In particular, one family we saw fascinated me with some indefinable quality of their own. The parents appeared to be in their 30s. The wife was a small brown mouse of a person and it was easy to see that the focal point of her life was her husband. Pale, prematurely aged, he had the face of one who had endured some terrible experience, but had won through. I believed them to be Continental folk and wondered whether they were Jewish.</p> 
<p>Suddenly I realised the difference between them and the other holiday makers. Happiness is something that New Zealanders wear casually as a cloak thrown about our shoulders. But this family wore theirs hugged tightly about them. They appeared so devoted to one another in a quiet and rather special sort of way. One day while sunbathing, I saw the unusual sight of a man in a towelling beach robe walking toward the water. Then I noticed how pitifully thin were his legs. As he slipped off the robe before striding into the surf, I saw his terribly scarred back and dropped my eyes, an intruder on his privacy. Here was an individual result of the maelstrom of fury and violence that had shaken the world. Here, too, we had witnessed the spiritual victory of one family over mental and physical anguish. The experience left a tremendous impact on me, as vivid today as it was then.”</p>

        <title>Rural school road safety initiatives welcomed 25-Jan-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, January 25, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/School-bus-Sign2_sized.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="School bus safety" src="/images/School-bus-Sign2_sized.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 150px; padding: 5px; float: left;" align="left"> Rural Women New Zealand has cause to celebrate ‘Back to School’ &nbsp;this year as two rural safety initiatives it’s been promoting get the green light.</p> 
<p>We have been advocating for safer speeds around rural schools for several years, and are thrilled that variable speed limits are to be extended to 23 rural schools, following the success of a trial at seven rural schools in 2012, &nbsp;says Rural Women New Zealand national president, Liz Evans.<br> <br> “We’re also delighted that a trial of active, flashing, 20km/h signage is to go ahead on a fleet of school buses in Ashburton early this year, with funding approved just before Christmas.<br> <br> “Our rural children are often placed in very vulnerable situations getting to and from school, and we welcome both these initiatives to raise driver awareness and slow down traffic,” says Mrs Evans. &nbsp;“We will be actively promoting both these to our nationwide network of members.”<br> <br> In the first trial, the NZ Transport Agency says the variable speed limits have resulted in an improvement in driver behaviour and reduction in speeds around the rural schools that took part, and the trial will be extended to 23 sites by the end of 2013.<br> <br> The variable speed limit is set at 70km/h past schools in 100km/h zones, and 60km/h for schools in 80km/h areas.<br> <br> The speeds are displayed on electronic signs, which allow the speed limit to be changed locally at agreed times. &nbsp;<br> <br> Mrs Evans says it’s encouraging to see innovative technological solutions being used to solve safety concerns.<br> <br> “Technology is also the answer when it comes to reminding drivers about the 20km/h speed limit past school buses, and &nbsp;it’s exciting that the Road Safety Trust has approved funding for a trial of active signage on school buses.”<br> <br> The four stage trial with a bus company in Ashburton is expected to get underway in the next few weeks.<br> <br> Bright 20km/h signs with flashing lights will be illuminated to alert drivers to the speed limit in both directions when passing a school bus that has stopped for children to get on and off.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[Rural Women New Zealand says if the government is to go ahead with its proposed partnership or charter schools, it’s vital that parents and the community are involved in their governance.&nbsp; 
<br> 
<br> 
<div>
  “We are concerned that though these schools are to be publicly funded, the Education Amendment Bill as it stands means that parents and the community may not have a say in how they are managed,” says Rural Women New Zealand education spokesperson, Anne Finnie.
 <br> 
 <br> Rural Women NZ believes there needs to be effective financial monitoring and transparency - just as there is for public schools - &nbsp;if private companies and not-for-profit groups are able to set up schools using taxpayers’ money.
 <br> 
 <br> “We also want to see a minimum percentage of registered teachers built into the partnership schools model.”
 <br> 
 <br> Rural Women is concerned that there is the possibility of quite a large school not having any registered teachers. 
 <div>
  <br> “We would like to see a minimum percentage of registered teachers, related to the size of the school.”
  <br> 
  <br> Rural Women believes that there are some situations where partnership schools could work well, but the current proposals would see them operating without the levels of transparency or accountability that we would expect for publicly funded projects, and this needs to be addressed.

        <title>Financial stresses and family problems emerging as major factors in ‘Feeling Rotten’ survey 08-Feb-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, February 08, 2013</date>
        <body><![CDATA[In the week since it was launched, there has been a big response to the Rural Women NZ ‘Feeling Rotten’ survey. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Rural Women NZ executive officer, Noeline Holt, says, “We encourage rural people to take part, to build up a clear picture of what contributes to their anxiety or depression, and what helps them overcome it. This will help us in our advocacy role, as well as providing practical support.”
<br> 
<br> The latest survey updates an earlier one Rural Women NZ conducted in 2006, and aims to show if there have been any significant changes or emerging trends.
<br> 
<br> Rural Women NZ &nbsp;welcomes the support of agricultural-based organisations such as Federated Farmers and Dairy Women’s Network for the Feeling Rotten Survey. The organisations will meet next week to work on collaborative action to reduce the debilitating harm anxiety and depression causes.
<br> 
<br> Early responses to the survey indicate the majority of people feel anxious due to financial stresses. &nbsp;This is followed by time pressures and a feeling of being overwhelmed.
<br> 
<br> When it comes to depression, family problems are showing up as a major contributing factor, with abusive situations playing a part. &nbsp;This is followed by post-natal depression and work stresses leading to depression.
<br> 
<br> “On a positive note, people are telling us that friends and counselling services have an important role to play in helping them through difficult times.&nbsp;
<br> 
<br> “This is encouraging, as Rural Women recently gave a significant sum of money to provide counselling services in rural Canterbury to those affected by the earthquakes. &nbsp;It indicates we are on the right track.”
<br> 
<br> Rural Women NZ would also like to hear from people who have not suffered from anxiety or depression, or who have overcome it, and ways in which they have done that.
<br> 
<br> The ‘Feeling Rotten’ survey closes on 21 February, when further results will be published.

        <title>Rural Women Leadership course offers invaluable insights 08-Mar-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, March 08, 2013</date>
        <img>/Group-Photo---story.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/Group-Photo---story.jpg" style="border: 0px; padding: 3px; float: left;" align="left">Sixteen rural women came to Wellington recently from all parts of the country for an inspirational leadership skills programme run by Rural Women New Zealand.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>Heather Smith of Waimahaka says Growing Dynamic Leaders was a chance to network with like-minded rural women in the area of professional development.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>Midhurst member, Lorna Davies enjoyed meeting so many interesting women with diverse experience and backgrounds and meeting and hearing from many speakers in positions of influence.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>During the three day programme the women heard presentations from leaders as diverse as Bryce Johnson of Fish &amp; Game and former Wellington mayor, Kerry Prendergast.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>The women visited Parliament at question time and had a meeting with Minister of Women's Affairs Hon. Jo Goodhew, who updated the women on her current trip to New York for the UN Commission on the Status of Women.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>At The Ministry of Social development, the participants learned about the It's Not OK campaign on family violence, while in-house workshops focused on mentoring and governance, giving presentations, working with the media and influencing local government.<br> <br> </p> 
<p>The women practised the skills they'd learned by making presentations to Landcorp, sponsor of the leadership course, on the final day of the programme. these presentations, which were very well received by Landcorp, were a chance to present the grass roots view of members of our organisation and many of the day to day issues and challenges the women face in their rural lives, especially in the areas of education and transport.&nbsp;<br> <br> </p> 
<p>Amanda Henriksen, who comes from Darfield says, "I have gained wonderful knowledge on lobbying, governance and strategic planning and hope that his will help with my goals of entering higher roles in Rural Women NZ and local government roles. I am looking forward to working with Rural Women NZ in the future and giving the organisation's voice in my area, especially with younger members."<br> <br> </p> 
<p><em>The Growing Dynamic Leaders course is a selected group of women who applied for the spots. It is sponsored wholly by Landcorp. Look for information on next year's course opening later this year.</em></p>]]></body>

        <title>New Zealand Post services, rural delivery 26-Mar-2013</title>
        <date>Tuesday, March 26, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/postman_story.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/postman_story.jpg" style="border: 0px; padding: 5px; float: left;" align="left"> 
<p>Over the last couple months, Rural Women New Zealand members gave feedback on the NZ Post Deed of Understanding. The submission has now been given.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>In summary, Rural Women New Zealand understands the significant decline in posted messages requires the NZ Post to review its business model and Deed. We are concerned that rural people may by disproportionately disadvantaged by changes of service. Rural people could find themselves in a isolated situation&nbsp;resulting from reduced mail deliveries being coupled with inaccessible or hard-to-access internet alternatives. Rural Women New Zealand believes that urban areas will find it easier to cope with reduced mail deliveries than rural areas and should therefore be targeted first.</p>

<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Original Post from 30 January 2013:</span></p> 
<div>
 The Government wants feedback from Rural Women NZ members about changes NZ Post is proposing to its Deed of Understanding. &nbsp;This Deed currently requires NZ Post to maintain a five or six day a week delivery to more than 99.88 percent of its 1.9 million delivery points, and one to four day delivery to the remainder. &nbsp;NZ Post would like greater flexibility in its Deed obligations, due to a significant decline in mail volumes.
 <br> 
 <br> This is your chance to express your particular concerns and suggestions regarding the future of the Rural Delivery service. &nbsp;
 <br> 
 <br> Please first read the consultation 
 <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=120537" target="_blank">document</a>. &nbsp;Then answer these questions by

 <br> 
 <br> 
 <p>1. &nbsp;Do you accept that there is a need for change to the delivery services – urban or rural – given the significant and irreversible decline in mail volumes?</p> 
 <br> 
 <p>2. &nbsp;How can NZ Post best achieve its aims to provide a postal delivery service that is economically viable, without unduly penalising rural customers?</p> 
 <br> 
 <p>3. &nbsp;What are the key elements of the rural delivery service in your area that must be maintained?</p> 
 <div> 
  <br>

        <title>Recipe: Blue Cod with Karengo Salsa 02-Apr-2013</title>
        <date>Tuesday, April 02, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/Blue-cod-with-Karengo-Salsa.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<div>
 Try this for dinner tonight, Blue Cod with Karengo Salsa. 
 <img alt="" src="/images/Blue-cod-with-Karengo-Salsa.jpg" style="border: 0px; padding: 3px;">
</div> 
<div>
 <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
</div> 
<div>
 -6 fresh blue cod fillets
</div> 
<div>
 - Butter or oil as preferred (for frying)
</div> 
<br> For Salsa 
<div>
 - 8 tomatoes, finely chopped&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 - 1/2 telegraph cucumber, finely chopped&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 - 1 red onion, finely chopped&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 - 2 tbsp capers
</div> 
<div>
 - Handful flat parsley leaves&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 - 2 tbsp Pacific Harvest karengo fronds&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 - 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 - 150 ml extra virgin olive oil&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 - 1 tsp dried chili flakes&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 - Juice of 1 lime&nbsp;
</div> 
<br> 
<div>
 <strong>Directions:</strong>
</div> 
<div>
 1.&nbsp;Combine all of the salsa ingredients in a bowl. Season to taste. Set aside at room temperature.
</div> 
<div>
 2. Melt butter (or heat oil) in a fry pan over low (or medium) heat. Season the blue cod fillets with salt and pepper to taste.
</div> 
<div>
 3. Once the butter or oil is melted or heated, bring the temperature to medium heat and place the cod fillets in the pan.
</div> 
<div>
 4. Cook the fillets on both sides, carefully turning once, until the flesh has turned just white.
</div> 
<div>
 5. Serve the fish with generous portions of the salsa.
</div> 
<br> 
<div>
 <strong>Tip:</strong> Cut in to one of the fillets once seared on one side, whilst cooking. Watch for the fillet to begin to turn white in the middle, and remove from the heat as soon as this occurs (the middle can remain slightly translucent). This ensures the fish will remain tender and succulent, and fall apart into medium flakes when eaten.

<p>Linda runs a boutique accomodation company, Tairoa Lodge, which includes a Victorian villa built in 1875 in Hawera, Taranaki. She and husband, Steve, bought the old homestead on four acres in 2000. It has a Historic Trust rating, but was in need of renovation. For over four years, they worked on the property creating three luxury guest rooms, each with a private ensuite, and decorated with a mix of antiques and country-style furniture.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>In 2003, they relocated Tairoa Cottage to the grounds in order to offer a self-contained accommodation for guests. In 2007, Linda and her husband purchased an adjacent property, The Gatehouse, to cater to the corporate market. To compliment the business, the couple added a secluded retreat, Kingfisher Cottage, in a rural farm setting. Finally, the couple purchased Tairoa Church Hall, previously the Gospel Church, with stained glass and matai floors to use as venue for exclusive events.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Tairoa Lodge has Qualmark accreditation of 4star plus. The business has seen robust growth though Linda says it has been 'hard won.' <a href="http://www.tairoa-lodge.co.nz" target="_blank">Click here to visit the Tairoa Lodge.</a>&nbsp;</p>]]></body>

<p>Angela's business, Agri-Lab Co-Products Ltd, is based in Waipukurau, where she has become a successful exporter of animal products, achieving consistent growth; even in the face of the world economic downturn. The business specialises in supplying ingredients for the medical, pharmaceutical and dietary supplements markets, including placenta, glands, membranes, tendons, eyes, brains, blood products and glandular. Ninety percent of the products are exported to countries such as Japan, USA, Korea, Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Angela has taken the business from conception through to the internationally recognised company it is today. She says her location is a significant competitive advantage in the export market of pharmaceutical and bio material with NZ being a BSE free country and having good access to freezing works, farms and essential services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deborah runs Astronomy Adventures from Baylys Beach, Northland, where she takes people on tours of the night sky with NZ’s largest hands-on telescope open nightly to the public.&nbsp; </p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>With a passion for astronomy, Deborah arrived in NZ in 2005 with a plan of offering astronomy facilities for tourists and astronomers. Acquiring her first second-hand giant telescope and dome, she set up on her front lawn, and has since acquired five more telescopes and caters for groups of up to 40. The Skydome Observatory was fully operational by early 2006. The telescope to guest ratio is kept at no higher than 1 to 4, so visitors observe at leisure. Added to this Deborah tells stories and adds fun facts, myths and legends to the experience.</p>

        <title>Meet Jules Smith, 2013 Enterprising Rural Women Award entrant 11-Apr-2013</title>
        <date>Thursday, April 11, 2013</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="ERWA entrant Jules Smith" src="/ERWA Entrants/JulesSmith ERWA logo.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 175px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></p> 
<p>Jules Smith owns and operates WashBar Ltd. &nbsp;It is based in Whangarei, and specialises in NZ made natural pet care products targeting the equine and canine market. The products evolved from a soap making hobby, when dog lovers approached Jules to make soaps for dogs with skin problems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Allergies in dogs primarily manifest as itchy skin, and Jules’ market research revealed a market opportunity, which led to producing her specialist soaps in commercial volumes. She now focuses on wholesale supplies to pet stores and vets and has continued to expand the range of products. Her WashBar products are sold at 349 retailers across NZ and is exporting to Australia.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Jules' new products include, a horse soap and natural flea repellent for dogs. She recently developed a range of spritzers for dogs to freshen their coats, producing what she believes to be the first 100% natural, alcohol-free spritzer commercially available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heidi Rosewarne and her husband&nbsp;purchased a small blueberry orchard just outside Whakatane in 2002, knowing nothing of horticulture or blueberries. They had previously been livestock farmers in south Taranaki. It was a steep learning curve to develop a business from ‘honesty box’ roadside sales to the business that now supplies a range of blueberry products direct to the public markets domestically and internationally -&nbsp;30 percent of the harvest is exported, 30 percent is sold on the domestic NZ market, and 40 percent is sold at the shop.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Blueberry Corner started as one orchard in 2002 and has now grown to three. With all three orchards operating and growing season harvesting November-April, people are able to have fresh blueberries right from NZ 6 months of the year. &nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>Each year, new&nbsp;specialty&nbsp;blueberry products are introduced, and now include jams, relishes, juices, chocolate, soap, tea and honey. Go for a visit and try a few different items at <a href="http://www.blueberrycorner.co.nz" target="_blank">Blueberry Corner</a>.</p>]]></body>

<p><a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=131374">See the Draft programme here</a></p> 
<p>The Student Volunteer Army’s Sam Johnson and Helen Heddell, Farmy Army catering co-ordinator extraordinaire, will give a unique perspective on the Canterbury earthquakes as guest speakers at the Rural Women New Zealand national conference being held at The Chateau on the Park in Christchurch from 23 to 26 May. </p> 
<p>It will be an opportunity for 200 Rural Women NZ members from around the country to look ahead as they focus on the conference theme ‘The Future’s Bright – Inspire a Generation’. </p> “We are looking forward to coming to Christchurch, and are starting off with a bus tour to get a better perspective of the issues the city is facing,” says national president Liz Evans. &nbsp; 
<div>
 <br> “It will be a chance to see first-hand the effects of the earthquakes and the innovation and resilience of Cantabrians as they rebuild their lives.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The Land and Water Forum will be the focus of a Water Seminar being held on the first day of conference, with panelists Prof Jenny Webster-Brown from University of Canterbury’s Waterways Centre for Freshwater Management, David Caygill of Environment Canterbury, Green MP Eugenie Sage and Federated Farmers’ grain and seed chair Ian McKenzie. &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “The focus will be on drought preparedness, water storage and irrigation systems, which are not only topical, but also tie in with the UN International Year of Water Co-operation 2013.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker and Hon. Jo Goodhew, Minister of Women’s Affairs and Associate Minister of Primary Industries, will be official guests at the conference opening ceremony.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “Then Peri Drysdale of Untouched World will set the scene for our Enterprising Rural Women Awards ceremony. &nbsp;She will talk about her journey to success, from a nurse who didn’t know the difference between an invoice and a statement to a New Zealand fashion and sportswear brand icon.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The suspense will build as our four category finalists in the Enterprising Rural Women Awards 2013 give short presentations about their businesses, before the Supreme Winner is announced.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The Rural Women New Zealand national conference is always an opportunity to learn something new, be inspired and re-kindle friendships.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Workshops sessions will focus on technology, local body elections and the future focus of the organisation.
 <br> Social functions will include a Camelot-themed medieval festival and a gala dinner with guest speaker Leona Dargis, a visiting Nuffield scholar from Alberta, Canada, who’ll be sharing her enthusiasm for the agricultural sector.

With little local employment and just 852 people living on the island, Saskia started the business in 2009 making soaps, massage oils, calendula balm and lip balms. She now also makes a range of body lotions, hand cream and face&nbsp;moisturisers. All Aotea Embrace products are made with essential oils and home grown ingredients such as manuka honey, herbs, flowers, native plants and clay, giving her products the ‘Barrier’ touch.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>Saskia sells her products to those with sensitive or dry skin and as gifts. She keeps her prices affordable. Starting the business was a real challenge with no banks on the island, limited water and limited transport to the mainland.</p>

Herd About Hair &amp; Beauty began in 2008 when she realised the need to diversify the family’s reliance on dairy share milking income after the downturn.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>She first re-opened a hair salon in Riversdale that had ceased trading a year and a half earlier, growing the business to employ staff to work alongside her. In response to the success of the hair salon she rented a second shop next door and employed a beauty therapist, offering a range of beauty treatments in addition to hair dressing. Both the hair and beauty salons are now open six days a week.</p> 
<br> 
<p> In the meantime, Lynne has grown her own family, with a fourth child born in February 2011. She is also still involved on the farm, rearing calves through the spring. The success of Herd About Hair &amp; Beauty is based on offering rural people everything a city salon could offer, with exceptional service, with the mission statement ‘a little bit of luxury close to home.’ Visit the salon <a href="http://www.herdabouthairbeauty.co.nz" target="_blank">online</a> for price lists and services.</p>]]></body>

The business involves every aspect of honey production, from caring for bees in 150 beehives, harvesting, packaging and direct selling at farmers markets, as well as through retail shops and the company website.</p> 
<br> 
<p> The bees have access to a wide range of flowering plants, and honeys from different areas are not blended with each other, meaning customers can choose a honey based on the location shown on the jar, such as Horsham Downs, Marokopa, Four Brothers Reserve and Hakarimata, with each having its own special characteristics. The company also produces bee pollen.&nbsp;</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Stress word cloud" src="/images/Wordle_Stress-FORWEB.jpg" style="border: 0px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; float: left;" align="left">Rising pressures on farmers and alarming statistics that show depression is a real issue in rural communities has prompted rural organisations to get together to find real solutions.</p> 
<br> 
<p>A group of prominent rural networks have met to brainstorm on ways to promote farmer wellness. The group included Rural Women New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Dairy NZ, Dairy Women’s Network, Beef + Lamb NZ, AgResearch, Young Farmers, Rural Support Trusts, Farmsafe, Ministry for Primary Industries, New Zealand Rural General Practice Network, Rural Health Alliance Aotearoa New Zealand and FMG.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Several groups have committed policies and action plans on mental wellbeing and reducing farmer suicides, however the time has come to pool those resources and ideas into one holistic strategy that puts the farmer first.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>The meeting highlighted the fact that the poorer outcomes in terms of mental health of people living in rural communities compared to urban centres in New Zealand is of major concern to the people living and working in those communities. Ministry of Health data shows the suicide rate for those living in rural areas is 16 per 100,000 people, compared to a rate of 11.2 per 100,000 people in urban areas<br> The coalition wants to raise awareness of anxiety and depression in rural communities and to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. Stigma is a serious issue and often prevents people seeking help when they need it. &nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>It is expected that stronger connections and partnerships between the organisations will ensure better outcomes for those suffering from severe stress, anxiety, depression and suicide.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>The downstream effects of anxiety and depression are numerous. &nbsp;Poorer decision making on farm, affecting animals and the whole farm system, must not be underrated. &nbsp;This often leads to poorer farm productivity and profitability. The most significant effect of course is on the family and those closest to the person affected.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>The new coalition will explore the development of a Rural Health Policy, along the lines of the Australian framework.</p>

        <title>Enterprising Rural Women Award 2013 winners announced 22-May-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, May 22, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/LizDianeJill.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Liz Evans, Jill Bradley and Diane Coleman" src="/images/LizDianeJill.jpg" style="border: 0px none; width: 300px; height: 220px;"> Rural Women New Zealand is delighted to announce the winners of the RWNZ Enterprising Rural Women Award 2013, following an award ceremony at the opening of the Rural Women NZ national conference in Christchurch yesterday evening.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Liz Evans says “These awards, now in their fifth year, offer an opportunity for rural businesswomen to shine. &nbsp;Our aim is to showcase and celebrate rural enterprise, and this year the judges had 20 strong entries to choose from.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>The Supreme Winner of the RWNZ Enterprising Rural Women Award 2013 is Diane Coleman of Treeline Native Nursery, based at Ngongotaha, near Rotorua. &nbsp;Diane also won the Love of the Land category, sponsored by Agrisea Limited. &nbsp;(www.treelinenursery.co.nz). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>Treeline Native Nursery, which Diane started 17 years ago, grows and supplies NZ native trees, shrubs and grasses for revegetation and ornamental purposes, growing 300,000 plants a year that are sold to councils, farmers, landscapers, developers and the home gardener. &nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural Women NZ national president, Liz Evans, said Diane Coleman was chosen as the Supreme Winner out of a strong field of contenders, saying she displayed “skill, calm confidence in the progress of her business and a clear awareness of her market.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>“When demand for products slowed with the 2010 economic downturn, Diane adapted to conditions, made some innovative decisions and was able to maintain production levels.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“Added to this, the business is rural-based, employs several rural women and gives back to the community with fund-raising support.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>Other winners on the night were Jan Harper, of Bluespur Butchery in Lawrence, who won the Telecom-sponsored Help! I Need Somebody category.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>As one of New Zealand’s first female butchers, Jan, who’s been in the industry since 1977, said it was a ‘dream come true’ when she opened her own business, Bluespur Butchery, in 2009. &nbsp;As well as selling meat to the public, a big part of the business is processing for farmers and hunters.</p> 
<br> 
<p>A very successful exporter of animal by-products from Waipukurau took away the Making it in Rural category, sponsored by Fly Buys Ltd. &nbsp;Angela Payne runs Agri-lab Co-Products Ltd (www.agri-lab.com). &nbsp;Utilising animal parts that previously may have ended up in the offal-pit, the company specialises in placenta, glands, membranes, tendons and glandulars, with 90 percent of the product exported. &nbsp;This is shipped all over the world as raw products for the pharmaceutical and dietary supplements markets.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Kylie Stewart of Rangitikei Farmstay was announced as the winner of the Stay, Play, Rural Award, sponsored by Access Homehealth Ltd. &nbsp;Her 1500 acre farm has been in the family since 1901 and Kylie has breathed new life into many of the old buildings to create attractive accommodation for up to 19 guests at a time who come from all over the world to get a taste of New Zealand rural life with farm tours, horse treks, clay bird shooting and shearing and mustering demonstrations on offer. &nbsp;(www.rangitikeifarmstay.co.nz).</p> 
<br> 
<p>The judging panel also decided this year to give a special Rural Women NZ Encourgement Award. &nbsp;This went to Lee Lamb, a young farming woman who lives in Waikaia, Southland.</p> 
<br> 
<p>As her children grew, and unable to find New Zealand farm-themed books to read to them, Lee decided to write and illustrate her own. &nbsp;A self-taught writer and painter, Lee was also determined to have her books printed in New Zealand. &nbsp;She now has four titles: &nbsp;On the Farm Shearing, On the Farm Autumn Muster, On the Farm Milking Time and On the Farm Harvest.</p> 
<br> 
<p>In congratulating all the winners, Liz Evans said, “Running a successful business anywhere in today’s competitive economy is not easy. &nbsp;It takes time, commitment, money and a passion to succeed. And, of course, you have to have the initial idea to get started.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“And, in the rural context, the start-up and ability to keep going can produce even more challenges. The logisitics of running a business away from a centralised urban area can throw up hurdles such as access to prompt transport and communication – not to mention &nbsp;extra costs of freight and postage. &nbsp;All our winners have jumped those hurdles.”</p>

        <title>Diane Coleman is a 2013 ERWA entrant 29-May-2013</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="ERWA entrant Diane Coleman" src="/ERWA Entrants/Diane-Coleman.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 225px; height: 225px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Diane Coleman was announced the Supreme Winner of the Rural Women New Zealand Enterprising Rural Women Awards on 23 May 2013. She is also the Love of the Land category winner (sponsored by <a href="http://www.agrisea.co.nz/" target="_blank">Agrisea</a>).</p> 
<br> 
<p> Her business is based 20km north of Rotorua in the small community of Kaharoa. Treeline Native Nursery grows and supplies native trees, shrubs and grasses for revegetation and ornamental purposes. Established in 1996, in its first 12 years of operation production grew from 10,000 trees to 300,000 produced and sold.</p> 
<br> 
<p> An essential part of the nursery production is seed collection, and eco-sourcing seed has become a major factor in customer requirements. Diane travels through BoP and Waikato, contacting farmers for this task. The nursery’s location at 419m above sea level ensures plants are hardy and relatively pest free.</p> 
<br> 
<p> An interesting development over the last three years has been joining a bio-dynamic group and exploring planting by the moon, using an old Allied Farmers Co-op lunar calendar, which has streamlined the company’s propagation with surprisingly good results. Plants are supplied in bulk to councils, farmers, landscapers, developers and the home gardener.</p>

Her business, Rangitikei Farmstay, offers accommodation for up to 19 guests and a range of activities on and off the 1560 acre sheep and beef farm at Marton.</p> 
<br> 
<p> Kylie and her husband Andrew moved on to the farm in 2005, surrounded by beautiful landscape and scattered, largely unused buildings filled with ‘treasures’ – saws, stencils, pack saddles, and a push mower to name a few, used by the Stewart family on the farm for the past three generations. The couple began renovating the old buildings and first opened up a bunkhouse and farm museum. They have since converted three other buildings and have developed their farmstay business with farm tours, shearing and mustering demonstrations, horse riding, farm walks, clay bird shooting and hole in one golf.</p> 
<br> 
<p> They now see a range of guests from school groups, birthday parties, and overseas travellers. Continuing to develop, the couple are presently building a lake to begin water activities on the property.

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Rural Crime Survey results.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 112px; float: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Crime Survey Results: &nbsp;</strong>D</span><span style="font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #444444;">rink driving and speeding a serious concern</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Drink driving and speeding are key </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">areas of concern for rural people according to an online <strong>rural crime survey</strong> conducted by Rural Women New Zealand.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Over 80 percent of people told us that speeding was a problem in their community and 75 percent said drink driving was also a problem,” says Liz Evans, Rural Women New Zealand’s national president.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">While urban people are getting the message not to drink and drive, in rural communities there are persistent offenders who are still ignoring the law, with serious consequences.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">At the Rural Women New Zealand national conference in Christchurch last weekend, John Perham of Crimestoppers and Asst Commissioner: Road Policing, Dave Cliff ONZM, (pictured above) said rural people need to move from being by-standers in the crime prevention process to being active participants in helping police in every way we can to make our rural communities safe.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Often rural people will know who is regularly driving drunk, but there is a reluctance to dob in friends and neighbours.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">John Perham said people can give information about offenders to Crimestoppers anonymously, by calling 0800 555 111.&nbsp; Police can then act on the tip off and ensure these people are apprehended and prosecuted.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">John Perham said in most years 80 people are killed drink driving.&nbsp; But the numbers of people whose lives are affected is much higher:&nbsp; For every 100 drink drivers killed, 50 passengers and 20 others are killed, and 1,000 are seriously injured.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Seventy percent of the Rural Women NZ rural crime survey respondents also said that theft of fuel was a problem, while just over half saw theft of vehicles or of items from a vehicle as an issue.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Asst Commissioner Dave Cliff said in terms of machinery theft, such as quad bikes, it raises the question 'where were the keys?' "Let's engage in a little bit of self-protection." &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Dave Cliff also told Rural Women NZ members that police now see family violence as ‘incredibly important and the most important area when it comes to crime prevention’ because when children are exposed to violence in the home on an ongoing basis, boys in particular become less likely to be empathetic and more likely to become offenders themselves. &nbsp;Whereas when girls are exposed to ongoing domestic violence they come to believe it is perfectly normal, and later, that</span> <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">having a partner who is violent is normal.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Stock theft is also a problem, but police will only be able to get to the bottom of it when they start to get evidential material. &nbsp;Dave Cliff urged people in rural communities to report stock theft.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">"John Perham, Crimestoppers chairman, assured us that rural people should have no worries about confidentiality when using the 0800 number.&nbsp; The call centre is in the UK so even those of us who think we have distinctive and identifiable voices will remain anonymous," Liz Evans said.</span></p>

        <title>Y Front Up to Prostate Cancer 01-Jun-2013</title>
        <date>Saturday, June 01, 2013</date>
        <img> /Kiera and the Bachelors.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="padding: 3px; float: left; width: 220px;" src=" /Kiera and the Bachelors.jpg">Rural Women New Zealand officially launched a fundraising campaign for the Prostate Cancer Foundation of New Zealand called Y Front Up to Prostate Cancer at our National Conference in May. We publicly launched the campaign while at National Fieldays with "pikelets for prostate cancer." Adding spice to our launch were the Fieldays Rural Bachelors, who came along to support the campaign.</p> 
<br> 
<p> This campaign is geared at not only fundraising, but also to raise awareness among all men, and women, to talk to their GPs about screening and risk factors for prostate cancer. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Prostate cancer affects 3,000 NZ men each year - that's 8 every day! This disease has an unknown origin, but it is believed to be influenced by testosterone. Last year, the Ministry of Health set up a taskforce to begin to lay out recommendations and programmes for screening, similar to those for cervical and breast cancer. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Here are few items to consider for Y Front Up to Prostate Cancer:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>The fundraiser is taking place between now and the AGM on 25 November 2013. </li> 
 <li>There will be a large push in September. PCFNZ celebrates Blue September each year to raise awareness,<a href="http://www.blueseptember.org.nz/" target="_blank"> find out more here</a>. </li> 
 <li>Rural Women New Zealand National Office will collect the money and announce the total at the November AGM. </li> 
 <li>November is the internationally celebrated Movember month to raise awareness for prostate cancer. Don't forget to bring your moustache with to our AGM!! </li> 
 <li>Please contact National Office with your event details, or head over to our <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/ForumRetrieve.aspx?ForumID=629&amp;TopicID=13237 " target="_blank">Forum to discuss it there</a>*. National Office will assist with promotion and speakers for your event(s). </li> 
 <br> 
 <p> Events are in full swing already. The first off the block was South Taranaki Provincial who held a lunchtime event with former Stratford Mayor Brian Jeffares as the guest speaker. Jennie Purdon, Provincial president sasy over 30 men and women came along to listen to Brian tell his personal story.</p> 
 <br> 
 <p> At our National Office, a Cocktails and Nibbles soiree was held with some key partners. View our photobooth photo gallery and, if you're looking for how to set up your own photobooth, <a href="/news-and-inspiration/photobooth-tutorial-y-front">read our tutorial</a>.</p>

<p style="line-height: 150%;"><span>In the first half of 2013, the Constitutional Advisory Panel, which is an independent advisory group to the Government, is seeking submissions on New Zealand’s constitution. </span></p>

<ul> 
 <li>the pros and cons of having our constitution written down in a single document, </li> 
 <li>the role of the Treaty of Waitangi in our constitution, and </li> 
 <li>electoral issues such as the length of the Parliamentary term. </li> 
</ul> 
<p style="line-height: 150%;"><span>Panel Co-Chair Emeritus Professor John Burrows spoke at our national conference in Christchurch recently, and encouraged people to become informed and take the opportunity to make a submission.</span></p> 
<p style="line-height: 150%;"><span>There was a concern that interest groups could flood the panel with submissions and overtake the process, so Prof Burrows said it was essential for individuals to get involved and to have their say. </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'times new roman', serif;">This is an opportunity for people to tell the panel how they see New Zealand and its future.</span></p>

<p>“Given our rural focus, we are particularly keen to support someone who has an interest in providing health or disability services in rural communities.”</p> 
<p>Preference will be given to applicants who are studying at post-graduate level.</p> 
<p>Last year the scholarship went to a rural practice nurse, Lynette Downie (pictured above) from Murupara, for post graduate study in Women’s Health through Otago University.</p> 
<p>Full information and application forms can be found at <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz">www.ruralwomen.org.nz</a> (bursaries tab) or <a href="http://www.access.org.nz">www.access.org.nz</a>.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Trial of 20K signs on school buses aims to save children’s lives 09-Jun-2013</title>
        <date>Sunday, June 09, 2013</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<div>
 <img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/DSC05637_New.jpg" style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19px; width: 120px; height: 126px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #444444;">In a bid to get drivers to slow down, thirty school buses in mid-Canterbury have been fitted with illuminated flashing 20km/h signs - the legal speed limit when passing a stationary school bus.</span></p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The active signs were launched in Ashburton this week as part of a national trial that aims to get motorists to slow down when passing a school bus that’s stopped to let children on or off. &nbsp;<a href="www.facebook.com/speedpastschoolbuses">Check out these photos and videos</a>:&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><span style="line-height: 21px; color: #444444;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p>Our national president, Liz Evans, says 23 school children have been killed in New Zealand during the last 25 years when crossing the road to or from school buses, and another 47 have been seriously injured.</p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>“A perception survey our members helped to carry out in Ashburton in July found that 35 per cent of drivers did not even know that 20km/h was the legal speed limit, and very few slow right down.&nbsp; It would be much the same around the country.”</p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Data collected during the trial has shown that most motorists are speeding past school buses, with bus drivers reporting less than one in 20 drivers slowing down past a school bus. </p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The trial is being run by Transport Engineering Research New Zealand (TERNZ Ltd) with funding from the Road Safety Trust (NZ Transport Agency), and supported by the local police, Ashburton District Council and Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The <strong><em>Either way it’s 20k</em></strong><em> </em>awareness campaign has been running in Ashburton for the last two months. &nbsp;I<span style="line-height: 21px; color: #444444;">lluminated 20km/h signs with flashing beacons have been fitted to the buses operated by Ashburton bus company, Pearsons Coachlines. The company has the contract for 27 school bus runs from the Rangitata to Rakaia, bringing children to schools within Ashburton and outlying rural areas.</span></p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Pearsons Coachlines Depot Manager, Mark Cook, says while driving school buses he has seen a lot of close calls, “a lot of which never get reported”.&nbsp; He’s also witnessed motorists passing stationary school buses on long, straight roads at speeds in excess of 100km/h. </p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>“We were very motivated when the opportunity arose to join with Rural Women New Zealand, with a vision to improve the safety of our children around school buses. </p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>“The results so far have been extremely positive and now combined with the new 20km/h signs on the buses, I am sure that the current trial will prove to be successful.”</p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The signs will operate on Pearsons’ buses until at least June 2014. Bus drivers have already seen a change in driver behaviour, with a notable decrease in the speed at which motorists pass stationary school buses when the signs are operational. </p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Motorists will have a couple of weeks grace before the police begin to actively enforce the 20km/h speed limit past stationary school buses, says Sergeant Stephen Burgerhout of the Police’s Mid/South Canterbury Highway Patrol.</p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>“As there has been a comprehensive educational campaign, I will be highly disappointed to see many offences.”</p> 
 <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Rural Women New Zealand strongly hopes that at the end of the trial the&nbsp;NZ Transport Agency will approve the active 20K signs so that they can legally be installed on school buses around the country.</p>

        <title>Time to Plant your Garlic - and a Garlic sauce recipe 14-Jun-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, June 14, 2013</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Garlic.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Garlic.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 9px; border-style: solid; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19px; width: 120px; height: 109px; float: left;">Now's the time to plant garlic - any time around the shortest day.
<br> 
<br> If you haven't saved your own from last year, get your bulbs from the garden centre - just pull them apart and push into the soil about 5cm deep and 20cm apart. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> 
<p>Note: &nbsp;You can't grow the Chinese bulbs you buy from the supermarket, they have been sprayed as required on import into the country and won't germinate.</p> 
<br> Garlic is a good companion plant around roses, as it helps keep aphids away. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> So get into the garden this weekend, and come summer you'll be able to make an attractive plait to hang in your kitchen.
<br> 
<br> 
<p>Here's a<strong> Garlic Sauce </strong>recipe, featured on page 142 of our cookbook, A Good Harvest, courtesy of Moira Jenkins of Woodlands branch. &nbsp;(You can buy <strong>A Good Harvest</strong> at our <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/shop">online shop</a>.)</p> 
<br> 2 large onions
<br> 250 grams of garlic
<br> 1 tablespoon giner
<br> 500g brown sugar
<br> 4.5 litres malt vinegar
<br> 2 tablespoons common salt
<br> 25g whole cloves
<br> 1kg golden syrup
<br> 1 small bottle Worcestershire sauce.
<br> 
<br> Method: &nbsp;Chop onion and garlic. &nbsp;Add all ingredients except Worcestershire sauce. &nbsp;Leave overnight. &nbsp;Boil 1 hour. &nbsp;Strain through muslin cloth. &nbsp;Add Worcestershire sauce. &nbsp;Bottle.

        <body><![CDATA[<p>Nominations are open for the sixth Attitude Awards. The awards celebrate high achievers who have taken on the world and its perception of disability. Entrants range from supreme athletes to less known New Zealanders whose family, friends and neighbours think they should be recognised for their courage, perseverance or support for people who live with disabilities. Attitude Awards trustee Dan Buckingham, a member of the Wheel Black team, says success for the winners means more than a medal or prize. ‘‘We look for the stories of courage and determination that change the way people view what is achievable with a disability,’’ he says. The awards will be celebrated at a gala dinner in Auckland on December 3.</p>

        <title>Boarding allowance changes welcomed 04-Jul-2013</title>
        <date>Thursday, July 04, 2013</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women New Zealand welcomes the announcement of new boarding allowances for geographically isolated students and others who experience significant barriers to achievement at their local school.</p> 
<p>“We have had input into the Ministry of Education Boarding Allowance Project, giving an up-to-date view of the rural perspective,” says Rural Women NZ’s education spokesperson, Anne Finnie.</p> 
<p>“We believe the new boarding allowances reflect the changes in barriers to young people’s schooling since boarding bursaries were introduced in the 1940s, particularly for rural.</p> 
<p>“Times have changed, and with improved cars and better roads, many rural children can now go to their local secondary or area school, and we would encourage this.</p> 
<p>“Well supported local schools help build dynamic rural communities and as the average age of farmers is now well into their 50s, keeping our rural communities dynamic and vibrant is more important than ever.</p> 
<p>“However for those who have to travel greater distances on minor unsealed roads, the time and cost involved is a bigger consideration factor, and this is where the new boarding allowances are important.”</p> 
<p>From 2014 students who live too far from an appropriate school, (e.g. 60km) or where the closest school transport is over 20km away, can apply for one of 1,300 boarding allowances of $3,200. Further travel assistance is available for students living in remote island locations such as the Chathams and Great Barrier.</p> 
<p>Further boarding allowances of up to $7,500 are available for students with multiple barriers to educational success, such as low achievement, poor participation, behavioural and relationship difficulties or who have poor family support or negative role models. Boarding allowances are available for children to board privately.</p> 
<p>Applications for the new boarding allowances are now open, and close on 31 July. Guidelines and application forms can be found by <a href=" http://www.minedu.govt.nz/Parents/YourTeen/BoardAllowances.aspx">clicking here.</a></p>]]></body>

        <title>Photobooth Tutorial 15-Jul-2013</title>
        <date>Monday, July 15, 2013</date>
        <img> /images/PhotoboothOnly.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img align="left" alt="Photobooth DIY" style="width: 250px; height: 219px; padding: 5px; float: left;" src=" /images/PhotoboothOnly.jpg">At the Y Front Up to Prostate Cancer soiree at the Rural Women New Zealand National Office, a photobooth was set up to have some fun and provide an “unplanned” activity at a very low cost. </p> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<p>Here’s how we did it: </p> 
<br> 
<ol> 
 <li>Props. 
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
   <li>If you haven’t already signed up and started following Rural Women on Pinterest, now is the time! Pinterest is full of free printables. We have ideas available in our <a target="_blank" href="http://pinterest.com/ruralwomennz/event-fundraising-inspiration/">Events and Fundraising Inspiration board</a>. If that doesn’t interest you, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kensiekate.com/2012/11/06/12-pages-of-free-printable-photobooth-props/">visit this website</a> for 12 pages worth of free printables you can use at your photobooth. <em>Tip: wooden BBQ skewers work great as a handle for the printable props. </em></li> 
   <li>Dig around in the back of your closet, go to the $2 shop or visit an op shop to find fun clothes, accessories and anything else you can think of. </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Create a backdrop. 
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
   <li> Since this was for Y Front Up to Prostate Cancer, we used the y front and finger image with the blue background (<a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=141292">download it here</a>). If you want to print it cheaply, find a Warehouse Stationery if you can, or get crafty and create your own version from fabric and streamers! We used a projector and screen to get the image to display for free. The only problem – the image showed on people’s faces. </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Signage. 
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
   <li>Point the way to the photobooth and make it clear where it is! <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=141134">Download a PDF of this.</a> </li> 
   <li> Explain what to do to guests. <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=141136">Download our simple information sign.</a> </li> 
   <li>If you want, you can download these labels we created to put on the prop containers.</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Taking the photos. 
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;"> 
   <li> There’s so many ways to go about doing this, but the simplest way is to assign 1-2 people to be at the photobooth at any given time to take the pictures and help out in any way. </li> 
   <li> For more in depth ways to set up the photobooth, have a look at our <a target="_blank" href="http://pinterest.com/ruralwomennz/event-fundraising-inspiration/">Pinterest board.</a> </li> 
  </ul> </li>

<p> If you're looking for just the Y Front posters, you can <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=141164">download a group of them</a> in three sizes now. </p> 
<br> 
<p>We know downloading can be a bit touchy depending on your Internet speed, so if you’d like to receive the whole lot of downloads in this tutorial, contact Kiera, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c2a9aba7b0a3eca8a3a1ada0b1adac82b0b7b0a3aeb5adafa7acecadb0a5ecacb8">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> or 04.473.5524.</p>

<p>If you'd like to make this beautiful crochet rug yourself, you can! &nbsp;<a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=140087">Here's the pattern</a>. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bev says she accidentally created this beautiful pattern some 20 years ago and has made it many times for new baby girls. &nbsp;She says although it doesn't take her long to make the rugs, writing down the pattern was the hard part. &nbsp;If anyone needs any assistance with the pattern, contact our national office and we'll put you in touch with Bev, who's happy to help.</p>

        <title>Outward Bound Scholarship Available 25-Jul-2013</title>
        <date>Thursday, July 25, 2013</date>
        <img> /images/Billy Kerrisk at OUtward BOund.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" align="left" style="width: 220px; height: 220px; padding: 3px; float: left;" src=" /images/Billy Kerrisk at OUtward BOund.jpg">Outward Bound is offering a $1,000 scholarship for an 8-day, 27+yrs course coming up in either September or October. </p> 
<br> 
<p>One Rural Women New Zealand member will be awarded this scholarship. To apply, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.outwardbound.co.nz/funding-your-course/rural-women-new-zealand-scholarship/">visit Outward Bound</a> by 8 August 2013. Billy Kerrisk attended just last year and shares her experience with us.</p> 
<br> 
<p>‘What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us’ (Ralph Waldo Emerson)</p> 
<br> 
<p>Sharing words of wisdom is a daily ritual at Outward Bound and Billy Kerrisk says the Emerson quote is the one that really struck a chord for her when she did the course recently.</p> 
<br> 
<p>After eight days of pushing herself physically and mentally, Billy came home a strong supporter of the programme. “If only Outward Bound was part of the school curriculum – what a brave new country New Zealand would be,” she says.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Billy, of Bainham branch in Golden Bay, says it was the adventure of a lifetime.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“I have been taken to my limits (and beyond) on the Outward Bound Discovery course at Anakiwa. It will never be forgotten and I look forward to bringing the lessons I have learned and the strengths I have found into all facets of my life - personal, business and community.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>Billy was part of Scott Watch 569 and her group of 13 ranged in age from 42 to 74!&nbsp; We asked her to tell us more about her experiences.</p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp; How did you come to go on the Outward Bound course?</strong></p> 
<p>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw an advertisement in Rural Women Outlook magazine last Spring offering one lucky member the opportunity to attend the eight day Discovery Course at Anakiwa, sponsored by RWNZ, and was delighted in early December to be informed by Noeline Holt that I was the successful applicant. &nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Why were you keen to do it? </strong></p> 
<p>A: I face lots of mental challenges with running my own Ray White real estate office but lack in physical challenges – the body and mind are inextricably linked and I felt it would be good to face some of my fears – heights being one of them.</p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp; What were the highlights for you? </strong></p> 
<p>A:&nbsp; Arriving at Picton and finding that the course starts NOW – “Get changed, get in the cutter and sail it or row it to Anakiwa with these 12 other folk you have never met!!”&nbsp; It was just such a buzz every moment of every day – they reckoned if you were not running you were about to be late! Also you never knew what was coming next – staying in the moment was the key. And boy did we fit a lot in – sailing, kayaking, rock climbing, high ropes course, tramping, and two nights in the bush on solo.</p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Did you conquer any fears during the course?</strong></p> 
<p>A:&nbsp; Yes I discovered that I am not afraid of heights – it was just a rumour I had been telling myself for years!&nbsp; Also I have never slept in a hut so I conquered a “reluctance” of sharing a bedroom with complete strangers (earplugs were a great help!)</p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Was Outward Bound a life-changing event?</strong></p> 
<p>A: Appreciating living “in the moment” was big, realising that you can do anything you put your mind to with practice and perseverance was HUGE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Outward Bound for me started back in January when I started training – you had to be able to run at least three kilometres at least three times a week and that was a huge challenge for me.&nbsp; Not only did I succeed in that challenge but ran 11 kilometres at Anakiwa. </p> 
<p>What really hit me though was when I was on solo in the bush, I had time to reflect on my values and realised that I spend far too much of my time working for others and not enough time with my teenage daughters.&nbsp; So I have begun making more effort to spend time with them and I have challenged them to find exciting new things for us to do together. </p> 
<br> 
<p>If this sounds like something you're interested in,<a href="http://www.outwardbound.co.nz/funding-your-course/rural-women-new-zealand-scholarship/" target="_blank">apply for the Rural Women New Zealand scholarship now.</a> </p>

        <date>Thursday, July 25, 2013</date>
        <img>/cupcakes.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" align="left" src="/cupcakes.jpg" style="width: 220px; padding: 3px; float: left;">Originally, Rural Women was going to produce a fundraising book, however, due to the overwhelming success of our previous two recipe books, it was recommended we create a third.</p> 
<br> 
<p>This book will focus entirely on baking recipes. Send your favourite recipes for cakes, biscuits, slices, puddings, desserts, Christmas goodies, confectionery, madeleines, buns, Easter baking, scones, friandes, loaves, brioche, and more. We'd like some gluten and dairy free recipes too, plus handy baking hints, tips and techniques. Let us know why you like the recipe and if there's a usual occasion you bake the recipe for.</p> 
<br> 
<p>We need to gather around 500 recipes by the end of August, so please dig out your recipes and post a copy to national office, PO Box 12-021, Wellington, or email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f892999b93919dd69d9c9391968bb88a8d8a99948f97959d96d6978a9fd69682c78b8d9a929d9b8cc5ba999391969fd8aa9d9b91889d8b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e58f84868e8c80cb80818e8c8b96a59790978489928a88808bcb8a9782cb8b9f">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. This is another great fundraising opportunity for branches and a chance to see your family favourites in print!</p> 
<br> 
<p> Here is a great recipe given by Ruth Rivett-Cuthbert of Twig branch in Otago for a Tiramilova. You can also view this in the July 2013 Outlook. </p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>Tiramilova</strong><img alt="" align="right" style="width: 200px; float: right;" src=" /images/Cake3.jpg"></p> 
<p><em>Ingredients</em></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>6 egg whites</li> 
 <li>250g mascarpone</li> 
 <li>360g castor sugar</li> 
 <li>5 tbsp Kahlua</li> 
 <li>3 tsp white vinegar or lemon juice</li> 
 <li>1 dessert sp cornflour</li> 
 <li>400mls cream</li> 
 <li>1 tbsp cocoa</li> 
 <li>100g chocolate chip, flake or hail </li> 
</ul> 
<p><em>Directions</em></p> 
<ol> 
 <li>Preheat oven to 150C fan bake setting. Draw 3x20 cm diameter circles onto 3 sheets of non stick baking paper. </li> 
 <li>In a large bowl, whip egg whites until they form peaks. Gradually add the 360g sugar and whip a further 8-10 minutes or until the sugar granules have dissolved. Combine vinegar or lemon with cornflour.</li> 
 <li>Divide the meringue between the 3 baking paper rings and form into even, flat discs. Sift the cocoa evenly over all 3 layers. Place on baking trays in the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Turn the head down to 100C and cook an additional 30 minutes. Remove from oven and leave to cool to room temperature.</li> 
 <li>Place the mascarpone and Kahlua into a medium-sized bowl. Whisk together with an electric beater to combine. Add the cream and beat until firm whipped. Removing the paper from the layers as you go, place the first cake layer upside down on a serving plate. Pile on less than half the cream and smooth over evenly, leaving a centimeter gap at the edge. Sprinkle over half the chocolate. Repeat the process with the second layer, cocoa side up.</li> 
 <li>With the remaining cream, put a 2-to 3-centimeter ring around the top outer edge and decorate with strawberries and chocolate. </li>

        <title>Cleaning up Waterways with the Landcare Trust 30-Jul-2013</title>
        <date>Tuesday, July 30, 2013</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Barbstuart 002.jpg" style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; width: 200px; height: 126px; float: left; margin-right: 11px; margin-bottom: 11px;"><br> Small rural communities are getting serious about streams and finding strength in numbers as they rise to the challenge of cleaning up waterways.</p> 
<p><a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=141378">Read about</a> the work being done in the Aorere catchment of Golden Bay under the guidance of RWNZ member and Landcare Trust Co-ordinator for Nelson and Marlborough, Barbara Stuart.</p> 
<p>Barbara is full of praise for the support of Rural Women NZ members in the region. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The Rai Valley Rural Women are absolute Trojans in working on water quality and we've had great support from Bainham as well."</p> 
<p>Barbara's role is to support private landowners in sustainable land management, working with communities where water quality problems have been shown to exist.</p> 
<p>"Our job is to help farmers deal with that. &nbsp;We like our farmers to be the leaders, so they commissioned their own scientific reports and together they all sat around and decided how to deal with it. &nbsp;It's a bottom up approach, working with land owners and land care groups to help them to resolve their own industry issues."</p> 
<p>The three key messages being promoted by the Trust are that livestock needs to be kept out of water through fencing systems; there needs to be sufficient effluent storage capacity, with councils pushing for two to three months, and the effluent should be spread on the land at low rates when the soil can take it up to capture the nutrients, thus saving the farmer money."</p> 
<p><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444;">Rural Women NZ is a trustee of the <a href="http://www.landcare.org.nz">Landcare Trust</a>.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444;"></span></p>

        <title>Otago Paramedic wins RWNZ/Access Scholarship 02-Aug-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, August 02, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Annabel Taylor.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 21px; color: #444444;"><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Annabel Taylor.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;">Annabel Taylor is no stranger to rural medical emergencies and farm accidents, and now she’ll be even better equipped to deal with them, thanks to winning this year’s $3,000 Rural Women NZ/Access Scholarship.</span></p> 
<p>As a St John paramedic based in Taieri, Annabel works for both the Otago Regional Rescue Helicopter and the Dunedin ambulance service, responding to calls for help from the rural community.</p> 
<p>The scholarship will help cover Annabel’s expenses as she studies for a year-long Postgraduate Certificate in Speciality Care, Advanced Paramedic Practice at Whitireia Polytechnic in Porirua, near Wellington.&nbsp; The course includes distance learning and she’ll also be flying to Wellington six times a year for block courses.</p> 
<p>Access CEO, Graeme Titcombe, says, “Annabel was chosen for her academic excellence, professional dedication in providing medical care to remote and isolated rural communities, and for the potential benefit her study can bring to the rural sector she serves.” </p> 
<p>The annual Rural Women NZ/Access Scholarship is given to health worker who wishes to further their health or disability studies at post-graduate level, with a focus on the rural sector.&nbsp; Annabel was chosen from a strong field of 30 applicants.</p> 
<p>Annabel says she is absolutely delighted to be awarded the scholarship. When she’s completed her training she will be apply to become an intensive care paramedic.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;“I believe the rural sector is deserving of the most highly educated and skilled health professionals available, whether this be in the form of a rescue helicopter crew or a metropolitan ambulance meeting a rural crew on the side of the road to help in a crisis.”</p> 
<p>Annabel already holds a PRIME nursing qualification and post graduate diploma in health sciences.</p> 
<p>Annabel's win was featured in the ODT. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.odt.co.nz/news/farming/268314/paramedic-air-road">More</a></p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img align="left" style="padding: 5px; float: left;" src="/images/2013_Bee image_New.jpg" alt="Bee Aware">Bees account for over 5 billion dollars of New Zealand’s economy through the pollination of crops and honey exports.</p> 
<p>But all wild bees have been wiped out by the varroa mite which is also threatening the rest of our bees.</p> 
<p>“The varroa mite is one of the biggest threats facing our Kiwi bees. It has spread throughout the country and we desperately need to contain this dangerous pest,” says NBA CEO Daniel Paul.</p> 
<p>The NBA is calling for donations to help fund the fight to research and find a solution to the problem.</p> 
<p>The NBA says other threats to New Zealand bees are pesticides, including neonicotinoids, a lack of nutrition for bees and potential honey imports.</p> 
<p>“The government is considering allowing honey imports into New Zealand from various countries. But honeys from around the world can bring in a range of pests and diseases that would pose significant bio security risks for our bees.”</p> 
<p>“Kiwi bees need our help. In some countries bees are dying in huge numbers. There are some concerning bee deaths here in New Zealand but so far things aren’t as bad as they are overseas. We need to do all we can to help protect our bees to stop the situation getting worse.</p> 
<p>“Not only do bees contribute billions of dollars to our economy, most of our food depends on pollination by bees, as do our gardens. A world without bees is just too terrible to imagine.”</p> 
<p>To learn more about this cause, <a href="http://www.nba.org.nz/‎" target="_blank">visit the NBA website</a>.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand has created a <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=141746">bee fact sheet</a> for our members to use and distribute. It's always a good time to support our bees, but in August, New Zealand is really focused on our little friends.</p>

        <title>District Health Board Elections: Hard Questions 07-Aug-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 07, 2013</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>What are the big concerns affecting the health of your community? Will your District Health Board candidates policies and promises improve community health and well being? To find out, we need to ask hard questions on the big issues.</p> 
<p>At the National Conference in Christchurch we got the ball rolling with a workshop with John Ayling chairman of the Access Homehealth board. Access’s priorities are the clients whom they serve and the homecare workforce. There will be other issues unique to your community that you could challenge the candidates on.</p> 
<p>Here are some hard questions for you to ask the candidates at the meet the candidates meeting.</p> 
<h2>Shorter stays in hospital </h2> 
<p>Most District Health Boards have a policy for limiting a person’s stay in hospital by sending them home with a care plan. This is clearly a cost saving to the hospital but in particular in rural areas the funding of that care plan falls short of costs to provide the patient with safe care. One example is the travel costs for homecare workers not being met or at best at a reduced rate, contracts that expect the maximum service for minimum funding are putting providers at risk and also creating barriers for the best possible patient care by a highly trained and skilled workforce.</p> 
<h4><strong>Questions</strong></h4> 
<ol> 
 <li>What will you do influence policy decisions with regard to passing on Government travel policy funding to rural home care workers and what guarantees do you give that the DHB will ensure its budget builds in additional funding for travel for the rural homecare workforce with the offset being greater savings made by reducing patient time in hospital?</li> 
 <li>Do you think it is the DHB's responsibility to implement (fund and resource) the Govt's policies around early release (eg Crest) and people ageing in their own homes?</li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<h2>Maternity Health</h2> 
<p>The Government has funded DHBs throughout the country $38 million to resource new mothers in the immediate post natal period to stay longer in a maternity unit. Publicity suggests that a number of DHB's are asking new mothers to take early discharge without advising them of their rights to stay in longer to establish confident mother/baby relationships and skills.</p> 
<h4>Question</h4> 
<p>What will you do to ensure that your DHB uses the allocated funding for the purpose it was intended and will your board actively inform new mothers of their right to stay longer if they wish?</p> 
<br> 
<h2>Mental Health</h2> 
<p>The rise in mental health issues in farmers is causing alarm The suicide rate is over 15 per 100,000 where as in other communities the figure is much lower (around 10 per 100,000.) Adverse events create additional stress and while the community is resourceful it also needs the support of the local DHB. While the Rural Support Trusts and rural based NGOs provide sterling service during adverse events it is heavily dependent on volunteer support by people who are also affected by the same event.</p> 
<h4>Questions</h4> 
<ol> 
 <li>How will you encourage your DHB to invest more in mental health in particular in the farming population.</li> 
 <li>Will you support the investment in a directly funded policy to respond mental health impacts during and post adverse events when mental reserves are stretched. </li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<h2>Nurse Practitioners</h2> 
<p>"Nurse Practitioners provide the ideal model for innovative and quality health care in rural communities" - stated by the Minister of Health in 2002 in a foreword to the Ministry of Health Report – Nurse Practitioners in New Zealand.</p> 
<br> 
<p>It was further noted in the report, "...that much responsibility now rests with the DHBs, who will implement the role. They are encouraged to create a working environment .... that will ensure a sustainable and well-utilised nurse practitioner workforce."</p> 
<h4>Question</h4> 
<p>Does your forward planning for rural and community settings include ensuring sufficient nurse practitioners in place to maintain rural services and access?</p> 
<br> 
<h2>Funding for Home Support That Is Funding Other Services</h2> 
<p>Successive Governments have provided additional funding to DHBs for home support services for older people, only to see this funding diverted by DHB’s into funding other services.</p> 
<h4><strong>Question</strong></h4> 
<p>What will you do to guarantee that your DHB will commit the funding increases it receives from Government, including those for inflation adjustments, are specifically passed on to homecare service providers? </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A frequently asked question is why health care assistants with equivalent qualifications to a homecare worker earn more if they are directly employed by a DHB.</p> 
<h4><strong>Question</strong></h4> 
<p>Do you support home support workers having equal pay with health care assistants, with equivalent qualifications, that are employed directly by DHB’s?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We were pleased to see $20 million allocated over four years in the budget in May 2013. Concern has been expressed that this allocation to DHBs may not be directed to the homecare support as per the intent of the budget.</p> 
<h4><strong>Question</strong></h4> 
<p>What guarantee can you give that the DHB will fully utilise the additional funding provided in the budget directly for home care support?</p> 
<h4><strong>Supplementary question</strong></h4> 
<p>What strategies does your party have in place to address the fact that New Zealand young women have one of the highest suicide rate in the OECD (4th according to WHO)?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Please contact Noeline Holt at National Office, or your Regional Councillor if you would like any advice/support on issues of concern to you. This is your opportunity to ensure candidates know the issues.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Local Body Elections: Hard Questions</title>
        <date>Monday, August 12, 2013</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>What are the big concerns affecting your rural community? Will your Local Authority candidates’ policies and promises fairly reflect the diversity of rural communities?</p> 
<br> 
<p>Regional authorities are primarily responsible for environmental management, including water, contaminant discharge and coastal management, river and lake management including flood and drainage control, regional land management; regional transport (including public transport) and harbours, biosecurity or pest management.</p> 
<br> 
<p>While territorial authorities (city councils and district councils) are responsible for: local-level land use management (urban and rural planning); network utility services such as water, sewerage, stormwater and solid waste management; local roads; libraries; parks and reserves; and community development. Property rates (land taxes) are used to fund both regional and territorial government activities.</p> 
<br> 
<p>To find out, we need to ask hard questions on the big issues.</p> 
<br> 
<p>At the National Conference in Christchurch we got the ball rolling in a workshop with Geoff Evans, elected member of the Marlborough District Council. Here are some hard questions for you to ask the candidates at the "meet the candidates" meeting. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Please contact national office if you would like any advice/support on issues of concern to you. This is your opportunity to ensure candidates know the issues.</p> 
<h2>Inequities </h2> 
<p>The inequities of the rating system bears down heavily on rural land owners. The costs are high in relation to the benefits due to distance from rates paid opportunities such as swimming pools or playing fields, solid waste management, public and regional transport. </p> 
<h4>Questions</h4> 
<ol> 
 <li>If you have the task of leading rates reform how will you convince your rural constituents that your reforms clearly show that they will be fair for rural, noting that that one size does not fit all?</li> 
 <li>How would you convince the council that these reforms are essential for the ongoing social and economic benefits for rural and that policies should be developed using a rural impact assessment toolkit? </li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<h2>RMA</h2> 
<p>The Government’s objectives are to lift the overall productivity and competitiveness of New Zealand’s economy to ensure business opportunities, jobs, higher wages and higher living standards. However, we have concerns that, councils, as part of the collaborative planning process will have the option to adopt the proposed process and reduce appeal rights in some situations, but not in others. This would create potential for different components of plans to be addressed through different processes across the country.</p> 
<h4>Questions </h4> 
<ol> 
 <li>How will you ensure that the council for whom you are elected will adopt a consistent approach in their regional management plans? And how will this be managed noting the vagaries of each geographical location and population and economy structure? </li> 
 <li>Championing sustainable management of land and water resources for the economic, social and environmental benefit for all communities is important, however, rural often feels that there are disparities in particular around costs of compliance. How will your council work collaboratively with rural to achieve Policy solutions that ensure equality for all communities that are not overburdened with compliance costs?</li> 
 <li>What guarantees can you give that policies are developed are evidence based and not idealogically driven? Can you back this up with evidence?</li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<h2>Green Fields Capture and Infrastructure </h2> 
<p>There has been some controversy over the green fields’ capture of land outside of Auckland. Green field capture permanently removes food producing land close to the urban catchment. Transporting fresh food over greater distances forces the prices up, which disadvantages low income and fixed income families. It diminishes open spaces and creates visual pollution often due to poor design and lack of open spaces.</p> 
<p>History tells us that the infrastructure does not follow urban growth and leads to isolated communities and associated social problems. Building up with carefully designed buildings with outside spaces and access to open spaces would help mitigate these problems. Lessons learned from international cities could be followed here. </p> 
<h4>Questions </h4> 
<ol> 
 <li>What is your policy of protecting good food producing land from urban sprawl? </li> 
 <li>What are your solutions to managing urban growth within a restricted land use area? </li> 
 <li>How would you ensure the infrastructure, in particular public transport, aligns with increasing population and changing living environments? </li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<h2>Social Cultural Environmental Economic Wellbeings </h2> 
<p>The four well-beings (Social, Cultural, Economic, and Environment) have had all statutory references to them (in the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment) removed. Local authorities’ lawful roles, and how they perform them, are now reduced to include consideration about whether the matters they are dealing with “meet the current and future needs of communities for good-quality local infrastructure, local public services, and performance of regulatory functions." Probably more crucial, is that they ensure the way they are proposing to deal with a matter “is most cost-effective for households and businesses.” </p> 
<h4>Question </h4> 
<p>Do you accept that the four well beings are crucial to a thriving and productive community? And will you promote their retention in council planning? </p> 
<br> 
<h2>Community boards </h2> 
<p>According to Local Government New Zealand president Lawrence Yule (Stuff NZ 10/5/2013), community representation was an "absolutely critical part of what local government does" and that was where community boards - or similar organisations - could again play a part. He predicts councils, where community boards were appropriate would begin establishing them during the next five years. These included remote rural territorial authorities, which had "strong and proud" communities. He also added that, to be effective, community boards would need to be given more authority than they had in the past. </p> 
<h4>Question </h4> 
<p>Do you believe community boards have a place in rural communities, should their participation in decision making where it affects that board’s community be more robust than just being consulted?</p> 
<br> 
<h2>Speed Limits Around Schools </h2> 
<p>Some councils have already set 40kph speed limits around urban schools and there is a move to extend this to rural schools for example Selwyn District Council to name one. Research tells us that a vehicle moving at the slower speed of 40kph means a greater reduction in accidents and injuries to children.</p> 
<h4>Question </h4> 
<p>If your council does not already have a 40kph speed past a rural school policy in place will you be advocating for one?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Rural Roads </h2> 
<p>Rural roads are often in poor condition and dangerous. Accidents leading to injury and even death would be preventable if roads were upgraded. The average social and economic cost of a person dying in a car accident is around $3.8 million according to NZTA.</p> 
<h4>Question </h4> 
<p>While we expect this to be a staged activity due to the number of roads and associated costs will you support a policy that will ensure all rural roads are upgraded by 2033? Do you think the cost off set to a life saved is worth the investment? If not, why not?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Fluoride </h2> 
<p>The debate whether to fluoridate our public drinking water or not can be polarising. Howeve,r using evidence-based models, the Ministry of Health and DHBs advocate strongly for water fluoridation which is proven to reduce or prevent dental caries. Low income families do not have funds for fluoride toothpastes or to medicate their families with fluoride tablets.</p> 
<p>Tooth decay leads to head pain, throat infections, stomach problems, and heart disease, as well as lowered resistance to bacterial infection. </p> 
<h4>Question </h4> 
<p>Do you believe that fluoridated drinking water is a public good? </p>]]></body>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="float: left; padding: 4px; width: 220px; height: 270px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/images/Topp Twins for Website.jpg">Well-loved New Zealand entertainers Lynda and Jools Topp are taking to the road in October with a new show paying homage to country music greats, and celebrating original Kiwi country music.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Reminiscent of Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry, the Topps’ hilarious characters, the Ginghams, will host the show just as the Minnie Pearls did back in Nashville in the 1930s. Audiences can expect the best in country music from rockabilly to bluegrass, comedy and gospel, and even a visitation by Country Music Hall of Famers channeled in by the Topp Twins’ characters.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The Grand Ole T’Oppry will feature award-winning country artists Tami Neilson, Delaney Davidson and Marlon Williams alongside rising stars including the all-girl Johnny Cash band, The Johnnys and Wellington-based duo Eb &amp; Sparrow (North Island shows only), plus special guests.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The 11-centre tour begins in Invercargill on Wednesday 9 October before heading to Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru, Ashburton, Hamilton, Auckland, Napier, Palmerston North, Wellington and Christchurch.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Lynda Topp says that just as Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry has changed over the years, like the Topp Twins, it has remained a cultural institution.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"We wish to pay respect to the legends of country music who have gone before us and also acknowledge the next generation of musicians who have, like us, been inspired, by past greats,” she says.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“Our take on the Grand Ole Opry (T’Oppry) will celebrate country music's diversity and will be a night of rollicking good fun, foot-stomping music to live by, and connection to something larger than ourselves.” </p> 
<br> 
<p>Tickets for The Grand Ole T’Oppry are on sale from Monday 8 July via usual ticketing agents or visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.topptwins.com">www.topptwins.com</a>. </p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Olive Webb.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;"> Introducing Olive Webb, an independent Rural Women NZ member from Hororata, Canterbury who is standing for the Mayoralty of Selwyn.</p> 
<p><em><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand?</span></em></p> 
<p>Absolutely. &nbsp;I live in rural Canterbury. &nbsp;I have been a member of the Canterbury District Health Board for 13 years and was a board member of Rural Women NZ's company, Access Homehealth Ltd for six years. &nbsp;I am a rural woman. &nbsp;It is a natural progression to move from the Health Board to the mayoralty, where I can be more focused on wider rural issues than just health.</p> 
<p><em><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for the mayor?</span></em></p> 
<p>The people of Selwyn need a champion and leader to ensure that they can enjoy the quality of life that they should have. &nbsp;They need someone who loves Selwyn, who understands rural issues, and who also understands the diverse challenges facing the fastest growing district in New Zealand.</p> 
<p><em><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three rural issues facing the Selwyn community?</span></em></p> 
<ol> 
 <li><span style="line-height: 21px; color: #444444;">Intensification of land use challenges us to manage our water so that it is plentiful and clean and sustainably managed.</span></li> 
 <li><span style="line-height: 21px; color: #444444;">Rural roads are fast and deadly if not well maintained. &nbsp;The intensification of land use means that hundreds of milk tankers, logging trucks as well as increased numbers of cars are thrashing the roads. &nbsp;We must have a comprehensive plan for maintaining and repairing roads.</span></li> 
 <li><span style="line-height: 21px; color: #444444;">The mayor and Council must engage with ratepayers and stakeholders across the whole district. &nbsp;Those working the land must be positively supported to apply best land use practices that the environment can sustain.</span></li> 
</ol> 
<p><em><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting the rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></em></p> 
<p>Closer engagement of the mayor and Council with the people of Selwyn, so that the Selwyn District Council is positive and innovative in assisting people's developments and productivity. &nbsp;It should be easy to do well in a beautiful place like Selwyn. &nbsp;As Mayor, I will be the ratepayers' biggest champion.</p>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Fiona Gower standing for Onewhero-Tuakau community board 21-Aug-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, August 21, 2013</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Fiona Gower_New.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-style: solid; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19px; float: left;">Congratulations to Onewhero Rural Women NZ member, Fiona Gower, a first time candidate, who was elected to the Onewhero-Tuakau Community Board in the Local Elections 2013.</p> 
<p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;"><em>Fiona, what inspired you to put your hand up for local body politics?</em></span></p> 
<p>Being involved in the community in other ways, I saw an opening for me on the Board. &nbsp;I also had a couple of people I know approach me and ask whether I was interested in standing, and this is really what got me thinking about it.</p> 
<p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;"><em>Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand?</em></span></p> 
<p>Yes, being a member did influence me in a number of ways. &nbsp;Of course, firstly, being on the Agri-Women's Development Trust Escalator Programme this year has enhanced my governance, strategic and financial skills, along with leadership and communication skills. &nbsp;This has given me the ability and confidence to stand. &nbsp;Also being a Rural Women member has shown me the importance of supporting our communities, and this is one way of doing it. &nbsp;I have built up a wonderful network in the area through our local Onewhero group and our activities, which means I feel I have a good chance.</p> 
<p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;"><em>What do you see as the most important qualities for a community board member?</em></span></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Good governance skills, being able to create, follow and change strategic plans, and able to evaluate their effectiveness;</li> 
 <li>Good communication skills - being able to talk to the communities and ready to listen to their issues, then report back to get points across</li> 
 <li>Being able to work in a group, often with a range of personalities and backgrounds</li> 
 <li>Being involved in the community, the issues and knowing the people in it, so people know who to go to if they have an issue, and board members and councillors knowing strategic people in the community to go to about issues or with information.</li> 
</ul> 
<br> 
<p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;"><em>What are the top three rural issues facing the Onewhero community?</em></span></p> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Change of land use with the population growth potential, and housing for these people.</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Equality of services with urban counterparts - roads, communication etc</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;Rural representation on all district/board issues, to make sure the rural voice is heard.</p> 
<p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;"><em>If you could change one thing affecting your rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</em></span></p> 
<p>That the community has a better idea of what the Community Board does and how they can interact with it and have a voice for their issues - so they have somewhere to go to raise issues and be heard, other than by their local councillor. &nbsp;And to make sure things are heard and dealt with by the Council.</p>]]></body>

<p>"I will do my best for another three years," she says.</p> 
<p><em style="color: #4bacc6; font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; font-variant: inherit;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand for Council again?</em></p> 
<p>The opportunities I have received as a member of Rural Women NZ have certainly had a huge impact on where I am now. &nbsp;It started with attending the Wellington Experience leadership programme. &nbsp;From there I received a scholarship to attend the Institute of Directors 'Certificate in Company Direction' course.</p> 
<p><em style="color: #4bacc6; font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px; line-height: 21px;">What inspired you to put up your hand for local body politics?</em></p> 
<p><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I have been involved in many community groups over many years, the next step was Council.</span></p> 
<p><em style="line-height: 21px; color: #4bacc6; font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local councillor?</em></p> 
<p>Passion for your area, honesty, integrity, desire to improve infrastructures and the district we live in.</p> 
<p><em style="line-height: 21px; color: #4bacc6; font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px;">What are the top three rural issues facing your community?</em></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px;"><em><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">1. &nbsp;Declining budgets from national government, mainly roading</span></em></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">2. &nbsp;Reminding the higher powers where the larger portion of export earnings come from.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">3. &nbsp;Retaining services, i.e. NZ Post, health, education.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><em style="line-height: 21px; color: #4bacc6; font-family: georgia; font-size: 16px;">If you could change one thing affecting your rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</em><br> <em style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Watching that rates are at a manageable level. &nbsp;It's a fine balance between what is required to provide best possible levels of service at a fair cost.</span></em><br> <br> </span><br> </span><br> <br> <br> <br> </p>]]></body>

        <date>Friday, August 23, 2013</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Pam Thomlinson cropped_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<div>
 <img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Pam Thomlinson cropped_New.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-style: solid; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19px; width: 150px; height: 150px; float: left;">Pam Thomlinson, Rural Women NZ national councillor for Top of the South Island, is standing for the Nelson/Marlborough District Health Board in the forthcoming elections.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Pam, what inspired you to put your hand up for election?</span></h5> 
<p>Because there are a lot of issues surrounding our hospital, and around home carers' and travel payments, as well as the retention of existing services for rural people.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand?</span></h5> 
<p>Yes. &nbsp;The experience and confidence that being a Rural Women NZ member and a national councillor have given me were the 'light bulb moment' that inspired me to put up my hand.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a District Health Board member?</span></h5> 
<p>Qualities would include being able to listen and take on board concerns that people have about their services, or lack of them, as well as transparency.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three health issues facing your community?</span></h5> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Keeping hospital services in Marlborough;</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Retaining rural GP services in rural areas; and</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;Ensuring that we are doing the best for our large area, keeping in mind that rural needs to have as good a service as our urban cousins.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting your rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>Ensuring that older people in rural areas have the same access to in-home services as urban people do, and that means that travel for carers must be paid at realistic rates.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Geoff Evans standing for Marlborough District rural ward 23-Aug-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, August 23, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Geoff Evans cropped_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Geoff Evans cropped_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 137px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Congratulations to Geoff Evans an Associate member of Rural Women New Zealand who has just been re-elected for a second term for the Marlborough District Council in the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Wairau/Awatere ward.</span></p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Looking to the next three years, Geoff says:</span></h5> 
<p>There is unfinished business and much more to achieve. &nbsp;Also, it is vital that farmers and other rural landowners are represented.</p> 
<p><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">There needs to be strong rural representation on councils - particularly unitary authorities like Marlborough. Services supplied and rating are very different for rural and urban people. &nbsp;There is a population crossover, but rural people are usually a minority. &nbsp;Achieving a fair balance is not always easy, and promoting understanding is essential.</span><br> <span style="line-height: 21px; color: #444444;">Having spent a number of years trying to cajole Council to accept and understand rural issues in both Federated Farmers and Rural Women NZ, I thought I could achieve better outcomes for all around the Council table. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 16px; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand then?</span></p> 
<p>Yes. Support from Rural Women has been very important and encouraging over the past term.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local councillor?</span></h5> 
<p>The most important qualities are fairness, balance and an ability to listen and understand. &nbsp;There is no place for extremes or personal agendas in Council business.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top &nbsp;rural issues facing your community?</span></h5> 
<p>In Marlborough currently they are:</p> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Earthquake recovery for the badly affected Wairau/Awatere ward.</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Water issues - use, storage and availability (including reticulation for rural towns).</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;Regulatory reform - central government has directed councils to improve their regulatory delivery processes to achieve cost and time savings. &nbsp;I support this.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Reflecting on your previous term in office, what were the high and low points?</span></h5> 
<p>The most distressing thing was the huge property revaluation-driven rate increases for some. &nbsp;Over 40 percent for some rural people. &nbsp;Individuals cannot afford increases of this magnitude. &nbsp;I suggested several options to smooth this impact.</p> 
<p>One achievement was to get Council to agree to review their Freedom Camping Bylaw.</p>

        <title>Trial of 20K signs on school buses aims to save children's lives 30-Aug-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, August 30, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/DSC05637_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/DSC05637_New.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 3px;">In a bid to get drivers to slow down, thirty school buses in mid-Canterbury have been fitted with illuminated flashing 20km/h signs - the legal speed limit when passing a stationary school bus.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">The active signs were launched in Ashburton this week as part of a national trial that aims to get motorists to slow down when passing a school bus that’s stopped to let children on or off. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/speedpastschoolbuses">Click here for pictures and videos</a>.</span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">Our national president, Liz Evans, says 23 school children have been killed in New Zealand during the last 25 years when crossing the road to or from school buses, and another 47 have been seriously injured.</span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">“A perception survey our members helped to carry out in Ashburton in July found that 35 per cent of drivers did not even know that 20km/h was the legal speed limit, and very few slow right down.&nbsp; It would be much the same around the country.”</span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">Data collected during the trial has shown that most motorists are speeding past school buses, with bus drivers reporting less than one in 20 drivers slowing down past a school bus. </span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">The trial is being run by Transport Engineering Research New Zealand (TERNZ Ltd) with funding from the Road Safety Trust (NZ Transport Agency), and supported by the local police, Ashburton District Council and Rural Women New Zealand.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">The <strong><em>Either way it’s 20k</em></strong><em> </em>awareness campaign has been running in Ashburton for the last two months.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">This week illuminated 20km/h signs with flashing beacons have been fitted to the buses operated by Ashburton bus company, Pearsons Coachlines. The company has the contract for 27 school bus runs from the Rangitata to Rakaia, bringing children to schools within Ashburton and outlying rural areas.</span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">Pearsons Coachlines Depot Manager, Mark Cook, says while driving school buses he has seen a lot of close calls, “a lot of which never get reported”.&nbsp; He’s also witnessed motorists passing stationary school buses on long, straight roads at speeds in excess of 100km/h. </span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">“We were very motivated when the opportunity arose to join with Rural Women New Zealand, with a vision to improve the safety of our children around school buses. </span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">“The results so far have been extremely positive and now combined with the new 20km/h signs on the buses, I am sure that the current trial will prove to be successful.”</span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">The signs will operate on Pearsons’ buses until at least June 2014. Bus drivers have already seen a change in driver behaviour, with a notable decrease in the speed at which motorists pass stationary school buses when the signs are operational. </span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">Motorists will have a couple of weeks grace before the police begin to actively enforce the 20km/h speed limit past stationary school buses, says Sergeant Stephen Burgerhout of the Police’s Mid/South Canterbury Highway Patrol.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">“As there has been a comprehensive educational campaign, I will be highly disappointed to see many offences.”</span></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">Rural Women New Zealand strongly hopes that at the end of the trial the&nbsp;NZ Transport Agency will approve the active 20K signs so that they can legally be installed on school buses around the country.</span></p>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Irene Mosley candidate for Dunedin City Council 30-Aug-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, August 30, 2013</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Irene Mosley_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<div>
 <img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Irene Mosley_New.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-style: solid; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19px; width: 150px; height: 138px; float: left;">Irene Mosley is standing for the Dunedin Central Ward of the Dunedin City Council in the local body elections.
</div> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand?</span></h5> 
<p>Rural Women NZ has certain had an impact on the path I have taken towards local body politics. &nbsp;As a newly married farmer's wife, I joined what was then WDFF. &nbsp;I took on office bearer roles at branch and area level. &nbsp;This taught me a lot about meeting procedure proceses, remits etc. &nbsp;I was fortunate enough to attend the Wellington Experience (Rural Women's leadership programme), and this gave me insight into the way that governance and government work. &nbsp;I felt now that my children had left home and with the experience I had gained working in community development for over 20 years, that now is the time to step up and put myself forward.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local councillor?</span></h5> 
<p>A councillor needs to be a good listener and communicator. &nbsp;Staying positive and being prepared to stand firm and be strong when necessary are also essential requirements in my view.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three rural issues facing your community?</span></h5> 
<p>1. &nbsp;At present the possible loss of Invermay research centre is a key issue, as that has huge potential ramifications for both rural and town constituents.</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;The balance between urban and rural rating is a perennial problem.</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;The third issue is that Dunedin city is starting to feel the pinch that loss of services causes. &nbsp;This is something that small rural communities faced 10-15 years ago.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting the rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>The lack of skilled workers, particularly in dairying, continues to be a key issue. &nbsp;Farms cannot work at full productivity without good staff. &nbsp;Dunedin City has high youth unemployment rates. &nbsp;We need to continue to look at new ways to encourage farming as a good option for our young people. &nbsp;As to me, Dunedin City with its strong mix of rural and urban ratepayers may be just the place to look at new joint initiatives in this area.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Mary Gamble stands for Southern DHB 31-Aug-2013</title>
        <date>Saturday, August 31, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/DHB.2013.Mary_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/DHB.2013.Mary_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Congratulations to Mary Gamble who has overcome the odds to secure one of four Otago constituency places on the Southern District Health Board. She said it was going to be a 'mighty challenge' to get elected as she was up against 13 candidates, so we say 'great work' to this Cambrian St Bathan's Rural Women member on her success.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">The story of why you you stood is an unusual one, can you tell us about it?</span></h5> 
<p>I was an elected DHB member in this area between 2001 and 2007 and towards the end of that period I was instrumental in exposing an employee who embezzled over $16 million from the DHB. &nbsp;This man Swann served four and a half years of a nine year sentenced and was released on parole at the end of July 2013. &nbsp;The first Parole Board convened received a letter <span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">from Swann's sponsor&nbsp;</span>which contained a threat to take and fund judicial review proceedings if Swann did not receive a favourable outcome. &nbsp;A new Parole Board was convened with a new judge and the man was paroled to live in a luxurious house in Christchurch. &nbsp;The DHB, the number one representative of the victims of Swann's crime, was not contacted by the Parole Board and when, belatedly, a letter was written to the Parole Board, it was deemed to have been sent to late. &nbsp;When I read all this in the papers I decided to stand again and pick up where I left off in 2007.</p> 
<br> 
<h5 style="color: #4bacc6;"><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand?</span></h5> 
<p>Being a member of Rural Women NZ has really opened my eyes to the reality of living in a remote rural region in the event of an accident or sudden illness. &nbsp;I have also developed a much greater appreciation for both St. John's and the volunteer fire brigade members. &nbsp;The New Zealand health system relies on too many volunteers - it is not sustainable over time.</p> 
<br> 
<h5 style="font-variant: normal; color: #4bacc6;"><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities of a DHB member?</span></h5> 
<p>The ability to listen and hear the health needs of members of the public and the ability to clearly articulate these needs as appropriate. &nbsp;A good Board member also listens carefully and hears what the CEO and executive have to say - getting the balance right is not easy. &nbsp;I always try to act towards others as I would want to be treated myself.</p> 
<br> 
<h5 style="font-variant: normal; color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three rural issues facing your DHB?</h5> 
<p>Our DHB is performing well by almost all measures and is currently working hard to shorten the waiting times for scans of every type. &nbsp;Our local hospital in Dunstan has recently acquired a new scanner which lessens the number of trips being made to Dunedin.</p> 
<ol> 
 <li>Retention of the current Health and Disability Services in the Southern DHB will be my goal if elected. &nbsp;New services will be a bonus.</li> 
 <li>Currently there is talk of the food services being prepared up country and trucked to our hospitals. &nbsp;I strongly oppose this.</li> 
 <li>Farming out the fertility services from Dunedin Hospital is another suggestion currently being looked at. This too I will probably oppose.</li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing during your time in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>I'd like to see all GP visits for children free, or almost free.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Sue Matthews stands for BOP DHB 31-Aug-2013</title>
        <date>Saturday, August 31, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Sue Matthews_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Sue Matthews_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 218px; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;"> Sue Matthews says she has a 'heart for health' and&nbsp;&gt;is standing for the Bay of Plenty District Health Board, having served as a councillor for the Maketu Ward of the BOP District Council for the last six years.</p> 
<h5><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #4bacc6;">Sue, what inspired you to put your hand up for election?</span></h5> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I was the first women to stand for the Maketu Ward and was warned that “it is all Federated Farmers out there” and “I wouldn’t have a chance”.&nbsp; Someone forgot that women vote!!! I had worked at the Te Puke Maternity Annexe for 8 years and Plunket nurse for 10 – which in a small rural community meant that I had been involved in every family with a new baby for 18 years.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I have felt that I have made a positive contribution to the Western Bay of Plenty District Council in the past six years.&nbsp; One of the ways is as Chair for the Community Partnerships Committee.&nbsp; I changed the delivery of this committee from people coming into the chamber to present to us – we now go and engage with rural communities (especially those not represented by a community Board) and having our meetings in community halls and on Marae.</p> 
<br> 
<p>This is an exciting time to stand for the DHB – both Tauranga and Whakatane Hospitals have extensive building programmes. There is an increased focus on the role of Primary Health at a MOH level plus DHB and PHO level – which is exciting and necessary to improve the health outcomes for our communities.</p> 
<br> 
<h5 style="color: #4bacc6; font-variant: normal;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 18px; color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a Board member?</span></h5> 
<p>Good governance and leadership skills.</p> 
<p>Good connections with the communities and be approachable, listen and enable solutions to be achieved</p> 
<br> 
<p>Ability to read and research topics provided with the agenda to ensure&nbsp; that the full picture is gained and the impacts of decisions are fully comprehended – including the social as well as budgetary implications.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Ability to interpret the budget and to ask the questions around prudent budgeting and identify areas for risk management early – enable a proactive approach. </p> 
<br> 
<p style="margin-right: 36pt;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; color: #000000;">Ensuring that the appropriate Key Performance Indicators are in the CEOs performance management to provide equitable, accessible, effective, high quality health care.</span></p> 
<br> 
<h5 style="color: #4bacc6; font-size: 13px; font-variant: normal;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 18px; color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three issues affecting your DHB</span></h5> 
<ol> 
 <li>Strengthening integration between and within primary and secondary health services. &nbsp;While continuing to manage and balance increasing expensive technology at one end of the health care spectrum to ensuring that there are resources to support health lifestyle choices that reduce the need for expensive health care in the future - can be generational change.</li> 
 <li>Engaging vulnerable communities, e.g under 4 year olds, over 65s, youth and Maori, to ensure positive health outcomes are achieved across the whole Bay of Plenty, including those rurally isolated communities. &nbsp;These communities have both strengths and challenges.</li> 
 <li>Reducing ischemic heart disease rates, lung cancer, motor vehicle crashes and suicide, as these are the top four leading causes of avoidable mortality. &nbsp;Reducing avoidable hospital admission rates for respiratory infections, dental caries, gastroenteritis and ears, nose and throat conditions.</li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<h5><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 18px; color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting the rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>There are lots of models that are being trailed to improve the integration of health care and this will be extremely important in rural communities where adequate resources are often a challenge, eg rural health alliance in the Eastern Bay of Plenty is one model being trailed</p> 
<p>Providing holistic health hubs within rural communities - Heartlands type approach where there is one admin for all the services – and includes social workers, budget advisors and competent nurses working with the nurse practitioner and health care assistants/ home based carers and where mental wellness is better understood and supported within rural communities.</p> 
<p>I would like to see strategic leadership position established in the form of a Director of Primary and Community Health Care - appointed across the three Primary Health organisations to enable some traction to be gained to be able to lead integrated care to be delivered across the whole Bay of Plenty.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Dangerous Decibels Programme 02-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Monday, September 02, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/Dangerous-Decibels-pic.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/Dangerous-Decibels-pic.jpg" style="float: left; width: 220px; padding: 4px;">Hearing loss is a big concern in rural areas. Rural Women New Zealand members were invited to attend a Dangerous Decibels training workshop to give them the tools to take the prevention message to schools and community groups. </p> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Dr John Wallaart, Programme Manager, Insurance and Prevention Services with ACC, says hearing loss is a major concern in the agricultural sector.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 "It's costing the industry something around $10 million a year in terms of compensation claims. It's probably one of the top claims from the rural sector and covers all types of farming."
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 The good news is hearing loss may be managed.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 "We did a lot of research a wee while ago and one of the recommendations is to talk to the children prior to entering the workforce."
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 In the last year, 30,000 New Zealand children have gone through the Dangerous Decibels programme, which is primarily aims at 8- to 12-year-olds - before they get to the secondary school age where it is very hard to influence them.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 The programme originated in Oregon, USA, and has been shown internationally to change people's behaviour.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Schools are keen to take up the programme, with more requests coming in than can be handled.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 This is where Rural Women New Zealand and other community groups come in. Last month, Top of the North national councillor Mary Dale-Taylor, Fiona Gower, Kath Gillespie, and Joan O'Keefe were trained at the School of Population Health in Auckland to deliver the programme.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Kath Gillespie says,"It was very interesting and informative. We were all provided with a satchel containing excellent notes and two discs covering the course content as well as the necessary tools and equipment to present the programme. We were shown exactly how the ear functions to allow us to hear including a demonstration of sound carrying airwaves using a tuning fork."
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 "The message that hearing loss is permanent and cannot be treated was emphasised along with the need for personal responsibility in protecting our hearing is necessary."
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Mary, Joan, Kath, and Fiona are now certified as Dangerous Decibels Educators. Based in the Top of the North they are available to speak to branches on request. The presentation takes about 30 minutes and is very informative. They also hope to get in front of local schools and Dr Wallaart says he thinks they will be very good at it.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 "They are well-respected by their local communities."
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 The programme is presented as a fun session with colourful pipe cleaners and other props. "It's not designed to be complex," says Wallaart. 
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Further free Dangerous Decibel training courses are being run in September in Auckland, and more are planned for other parts of the country next year. To express interest in attending, contact Dr Wallaart on 027 220 7387 or email

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Libby Jones standing for Northland DHB 02-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Monday, September 02, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Libby Jones_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Libby Jones_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Independent Rural Women NZ member, Libby Jones, is standing for the Northland District Health Board director position. &nbsp;She is currently an elected member of Northland DHB, since being elected in 2010.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What inspired you to put your hand up for local body politics?</span></h5> 
<p>In have spent a lot of the last 15 years since having children involved in the local rural community in a variety of organisations. &nbsp;I have been on the local primary school board of trustees as chair for many years, and this has given me an interest in governance. &nbsp;I have since joined the high school board. &nbsp;My professional health social work background meant that my interest in local government is with people and health, so the district health board fitted well.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h5 style="font-variant: normal;"><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand?</span></h5> 
<p>I am a relatively new Rural Women NZ member and am keen to support other rural women getting involved in local politics. &nbsp;Being a rural woman certainly gives a keener understanding of community issues, and the ability to work out solutions that may not be obvious to others.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a DHB member?</span></h5> 
<p>Ability to listen to all points of view and to be confident to express your view even if it seems different to others. &nbsp;Ask questions and have a perspective that looks at all the stakeholders, not just some. &nbsp;Have integrity and be professional. &nbsp;Have clarity around the purpose and role of governance, which is looking at the big picture, not the day to day management. </p> 
<div>
 <span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">What are the top rural issues facing your DHB?</span> 
 <p>1. Community - unemployment. Lack of economic development. Economic sustainability of farming and difficulty for young people to get into farm ownership.</p> 
 <p>2. DHB - ageing population and associated costs of health care; increase in chronic illness - diabetes, heart disease; preventable illnesses in children and young people - respiratory disease, rheumatic fever, dental decay, teen suicide.</p> 
 <h5><span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting your rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
 <h5> <p><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Increase the physical and emotional well-being of the region's young people.</span></p> </h5> 
 <h5 style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;"><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What achievement are you most proud of during your first term in office?</span></h5> 
 <p>The reduction in waiting times for surgery and specialist appointments and the increased focus on health promotion and illness prevention.</p>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Sharyn Price standing for Waitaki District Council 02-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Monday, September 02, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Sharyn Price_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Sharyn Price_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 120px; height: 162px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
<p>Congratulations to Sharyn Price, who secured one of two seats in the Corriedale ward of the Waitaki District Council in the 2013 elections. &nbsp;Sharyn is a Kauru Hill Rural Women NZ member.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What inspired you to put your hand up for local body politics?</span></h5> 
<p>A wise man once told me, "Service is the rent we pay for living". &nbsp;Having been approached by several people whose opinions I value, I decided it was time to pay my dues.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand?</span></h5> 
<p>Definitely! &nbsp;I am inspired by the many strong, capable Rural Women NZ members already in office around the country. &nbsp;Local members are very supportive and provide an excellent network for gathering community views - a great advantage for women candidates.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local councillor?</span></h5> 
<p>My top picks are passion for the district - putting the community's interest first - and the ability to negotiate, especially where urban representatives outnumber rural voices around the table. &nbsp;Being approachable and taking time to listen are also important, but councillors must weigh local opinions against detailed information not always widely available - a delicate balancing act.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three rural issues facing your community?</span></h5> 
<p>1. Rates fairness and value for money are utterly essential. &nbsp;Rural ratepayers have seen much larger percentage increases in rates than Council's annual averges, thanks to farm development and increasing capital values, while town values fail to keep pace. &nbsp;Paying ever more for a shrinking share of services is not reasonable. &nbsp;Extracting maximum value on a limited budget is in everyone's interest.</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Maintaining quality infrastructure is a huge challenge for our geographically large, sparsely populated district. &nbsp;High agricultural output and tourist traffic demand good roads, but national government contributions are dwindling. &nbsp;Other infrastructure also needs attention to keep Waitaki a safe, attractive place to live and do business.</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;Easy access to major services such as health care, education and access to government agencies is taken for granted in larger centres, but is easily lost from smaller districts like ours. &nbsp;Call centres and internet access (for those who can get it) never replace the real thing. &nbsp;It's essential to keep pressure on government to maintain local services and avoid becoming 'isolated' despite our central location.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting the rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>There is no good reason why we can't have a transparent rating policy that ensures each ward contributes the appropriate proportion to each budget item, regardless of changes in land/capital values over time. &nbsp;Contributions to each item should reflect the ward's share of the benefit from spending, rather than fluctuating with movements in rateable value (especially where relative movements differ greatly between rural and urban properties).&nbsp;</p>]]></body>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Joan Wilson - Strath Taieri Community Board 04-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 04, 2013</date>

Joan is a member of Middlemarch Rural Women.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to serve on the board?</span></h5> 
<p>Yes, as an extension of my Rural Women membership. &nbsp;I have been involved in voluntary organisations for many years, and the Community Board is just an extension of this.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local body representative?</span></h5> 
<p>Honesty, integrity and ability to see the big picture.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three issues facing your community?</span></h5> 
<p>1. As one of the two rural boards within Dunedin City, we endeavour to put forward a rural voice, which may at times be a little different to the urban voice. &nbsp;We are a small community, and fairly independent and just do things and get them done!</p> 
<p>2. Medical services</p> 
<p>3. Educational opportunities</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could influence one thing affecting your rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>We are part of Dunedin city, though 80kms away, and we are entitled to a reasonable level of service.</p>

        <date>Wednesday, September 04, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/KateWilson_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/KateWilson_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;"> 
<p>Congratulations to Kate Wilson, who was successful in being re-elected to the Mosgiel/Taieri ward of the Dunedin City Council in the 2013 elections. Kate is a member of Middlemarch Rural Women.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Kate, what inspired you to put your hand up for local body politics?</span></h5> 
<p>I believe it is very important that all voices are represented around a Council table, and as a rural woman, albeit one who was brought up in the centre of the city, and now living on the far outreaches, I think I bring an interesting blend of views and experience.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local councillor?</span></h5> 
<p>An ability to listen, an ability to consider social, cultural and environmental issues alongside financial and economic considerations. &nbsp;Being from a strong rural community and seeing how community can do more for less, and employing locals first informs me well for challenging other entrenched models of doing things in a city.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three rural issues facing your community?</span></h5> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Employment</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Rates issues related to property values, rather than provision of services, and low targetted rate use</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;Certainty of water management issues in the next 10 years.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting the rural community during your term in office, what would it be.</span></h5> 
<p>A vastly improved District Plan.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Ainsley Webb - Central Otago Health Inc Board 04-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 04, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Ainsley Webb_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Ainsley Webb_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 120px; height: 120px; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;"> 
<p>Ainsley Webb will be serving another term as the community representative on the Central Otago Health Inc Board, as she was unopposed in the recent elections. &nbsp;Ainsley is the current Chair of Central Otago Health Inc and is a member of Cromwell Rural Women.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What does Otago Health Inc do?</span></h5> 
<p>Central Otago Health Inc provides a link between the Dunstan Hospital and the regions in the Central Otago community. Central Otago Health Inc is the sole shareholder of Central Otago Health Services Ltd, which operates Dunstan Hospital. So this role is at the governance level for Dunstan Hospital in Clyde.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What inspired you to stand for the board?</span></h5> 
<p>I first stood in 2004. &nbsp;As I have a background in health and have lived in the area now for over 40 years, I thought I could be an informed voice for rural people and the Cromwell community.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women member influenced your decision to stand?</span></h5> 
<p>Having been a member of Rural Women NZ for almost 40 years, this gives me a broad base of opinions from the rural sector, as well as a network of contacts for gauging future needs.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for this role?</span></h5> 
<p>The ability to listen to the community, to listen to the needs from within the hospital and allied health departments, to research and understand all information presented and to make decisions in the best interests of the health needs of the community.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three issues facing your rural community in terms of health?</span></h5> 
<p>The main issues facing both Central Otago Health Inc (which owns all the shares in Central Otago Health Services Ltd) and Central Otago Health Services Ltd (which manages the running of Dunstan Hospital) are:</p> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Distance from the main centre - isolation</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Inequitable funding for rural areas</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;The inability of some urban-based administrators to understand the differing issues facing the rural sector.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What achievement are you most proud of, having served three terms in office?</span></h5> 
<p>The most proud achievements have been in my last term of office, when we were able to purchase and install a CT scanner, funded totally by the community. &nbsp;It was officially opened on 10 August 2013 by Sir Eion Edgar, as part of the 150 year celebrations of continuous health service at Dunstan Hospital, that I was Chairman of.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting the rural community during your next term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>I would like to see more available funding to help keep rural people in their own homes, particularly at week-ends, whyile the need nursing care, e.g. more District Nurse funding, more Palliative Care funding and acknowledgement of real travel costs (for care workers).</p>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Jacqui Church - standing for Awaroa ki Tuakau ward of Waikato District Council 04-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 04, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Jacqui Church2.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Jacqui Church2.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 120px; height: 112px; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px; float: left;"> 
<p>First time candidate and Onewhero Rural Women member, Jacqui Church, has romped home with the highest number of votes in the Awaroa ki Tuakau Ward of Waikato District Council, according to preliminary results. &nbsp;The ward spans a large rural area from south of Auckland right to the Waikato river.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What inspired you to put your hand up for local body politics?</span></h5> 
<p>Being honoured with the Franklin's Finest Person Award for 2012 has set me on this path. &nbsp;I am putting my money where my mouth is for a better way! &nbsp;We need a vigorous, much more consultative and inclusive culture and voice at council than we current have on the Waikato District Council.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women member influenced your decision to stand?</span></h5> 
<p>Yes! &nbsp;I realise how precious our rural lifestyle and values are and how very cool the rural women are I have had the privilege to meet since moving to the country from Auckland over 15 years ago. &nbsp;This very powerful thought gave me the strength to 'put myself out here', to hopefully add value in the long term to our community. &nbsp;Rural Women gives me strength of purpose and I feel supported!</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local councillor?</span></h5> 
<p>My reputation is based on a philosophy of being counted upon when the going gets tough; loyalty, honesty and integrity; supporting positive change and growth; and a no-nonsense, common sense and business-like approach, while always on the look out for some fun!</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three issues facing your district ward?</span></h5> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Reverse sensitivity issues that are rapidly increasing with the rapid growth throughout the ward. &nbsp;Horticulture is growing in the ward as current quality land use is changing over to housing and infrastructure needs. &nbsp;We seriously need some overall strategic planning, not the past usual haphazard ad-hoc planning decisions that have occurred.</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;As a mixed ward split approximately half and half rural and town, there is a generally held feeling of dis-enfranchisement with local government, its policies and the ever-increasing rates being charged throughout the area.</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;Managing the growth and getting our heads around understanding that we are on the ever-growing Auckland border. &nbsp;We need to get on board with the Auckland Unitary Plan and ensure there are cohensive and logical plans in Waikato that maximise our 'riding the growth wave' while sustaining and protecting our past heritage, environment and farming and rural lifestyles.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting your rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>I would like to see an appreciable increase in the amount of people excited and engaged again in our ward. That this silent majority is heard and considered properly in the consultation process, whereby the present culture of 'ticking the box' of consultation is actively taken seriously and the will of the many in our democracy actually works again. &nbsp;Have we women and particularly our younger women forgotten how we fought and won the vote? &nbsp;How we were the first women in the world to vote? &nbsp;This is such a precious gift of our own to honour. &nbsp;I believe the many make for a better, well-rounded society and future.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Copper Challenge 18-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 18, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/Image for Noeline1.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/Image for Noeline1.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 3px; width: 220px;">Rural Women is participating in a new coalition to challenge the Government taking over from the Commerce Commission and the unfair proposal to charge users of copper technology the same as fibre. The members of the coalition include a wide ranging mix of interests. It includes the following concerns.</p> 
<br> 
<ol> 
 <li> In a discussion document issued last month, the Government proposed transferring decisions for the price of existing internet connections from the Commerce Commission – an independent regulatory body – to the Government itself and to charge users of existing copper technology the same as those with access to the faster fibre technology.</li> 
 <li>The discussion document is poorly written and there was no time given for Rural Women to consult with its members. </li> 
 <li>The intent behind this is to make fibre the attractive option. However, this is unfair to rural who do not have any choice but to remain on copper - these being the lucky ones – with others still having no access to copper at all. They should not have to pay a higher price when there is no technology to migrate to.<span style="color: #444444;">&nbsp;It would be like the Government deciding that dial up internet should cost the same as broadband even if there was no broadband available in your community</span></li> 
 <li>While Chorus has lobbied the government saying that the figures set by the Commerce Commission are too low, and this is a point being made by coalition participants, our argument is not with Chorus but with how the Government has acted. </li>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Theresa Stark - Waikato Regional Council Candidate 18-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 18, 2013</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Theresa Stark_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Theresa Stark_New.jpg" style="color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; line-height: 16px; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px; border-style: solid; width: 150px; height: 100px; float: left;"></p> 
<h5 style="font-variant: normal;"><span style="color: #4bacc6;"></span></h5> 
<p>Theresa Stark received resounding support from voters who have re-elected her to the Waikato Regional Council for the Waikato general constituency under the 'Rates Control Team' banner. Preliminary results put her as the most preferred candidate by several hundred votes.</p> 
<h5 style="font-variant: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 16px; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;">Wha</span><span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 16px; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 16px; color: #4bacc6;">t inspired you to put your hand up for local body politics?&nbsp;</span></h5>

 <div>
  <span style="font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #000000;">Frustration in dealing with local councils for core services, unaffordable rates increases, and my advocacy roles within Federated Farmers led me to put my hand up for local body politics.</span>
 </div> 
 <div> 
  <h5 style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-variant: normal;"><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Has being a Rural Women NZ member influenced your decision to stand?</span></h5> 
  <div style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px;">
   <span style="font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;">Being a member of Rural Women NZ at the time also gave me a sense of empowerment as they are a strong and respected lobbying voice and are successfully influencing policy. &nbsp;In general, women from the rural sector don't always realize how much power they do have until they start to exercise it. &nbsp;Rural women need to support each other taking up the challenges of 'putting oneself out there' as it can be daunting.</span>
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <h5 style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-variant: normal;"><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local councillor?</span></h5>

      <span style="font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The top three rural issues are water, affordability and local government reforms. &nbsp;We all want clean water and enough of it for drinking, recreation, our businesses etc. &nbsp;It is the essence of life. &nbsp;The delicate balance will be in cleaning up lakes and rivers affordably, making sure everyone has enough water for their needs, and developing water storage policies to allay the effects of the terrible droughts the Waikato has suffered. &nbsp;Local government reforms are in the wind. &nbsp;It is crucial communities have their say in how they want to be governed. Talk of amalgamations are in the wind, but local views must remain in local government.</span>

      <span style="font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I would like to see our council undergo a culture change to an ethos of true public service. &nbsp;That is our reason for being, but all too often, bureaucracy overtakes common sense. &nbsp;There is a lot of stress in the rural community derived from council policies and how they are implemented. &nbsp;I want to see a 'how can I help you?' attitude, not a 'Rule 2.4b states you can't do that' attitude.</span>

        <title>Local Elections 2013 - Sue Wilson - Lakes-Murchison ward 18-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 18, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Sue Wilson_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Sue Wilson_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 199px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
<p>Sue Wilson is a member of our St Arnaud branch. &nbsp;She is standing in the Lakes-Murchison ward of the Tasman District Council.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What do you see as the most important qualities for a local councillor?</span></h5> 
<p>The qualities I see are about keeping the community in touch so people feel engaged in decision making, rather than only a few that might be involved in the community councils about the district. &nbsp;I have lived in the area for some five years and met my councillor for the first time at one of the 'meet the candidates' meetings last week. &nbsp;I intend to keep up my Facebook and Twitter accounts to keep my widespread community involved in open dialogue with what is happening on a micro level, rather than reading announcements in the newspaper.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What are the top three rural issues facing your community?</span></h5> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Tasman District Council justifies its debt as inter-generational equity, synonymous with sustainable development. &nbsp;However this can only be sustainable if future generations aren't lumbered with a large debt that impedes their ability to service the debt and be able to move forward with any future infrastructure they require. &nbsp;The proposed Lee Valley Dam has the ability to cause inter-generational debt unless we look at alternative funding models to assist with sharing the load such as public private partnerships.</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Growing GE or GMO crops in our district needs to be done through the resource consent process and be publicly notified activity, making GE crop growers pay a sizeable bond so that should there be an outbreak our farmers are adequately protected, otherwise without these protections we will all pay.</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;TDC's Long Term Plan is about having positive, healthy sustainable outcomes for our community. &nbsp;The community drives decision making by Council, so I support a collaborative approach in attaining these sustainable outcomes to provide a balanced vision of sustainability in moving the community forward, so we need to be proactive rather than being in damage control with regards to future weather events. &nbsp;A lot of work has been done on our renowned Waimea Estuary, so allowing sewage overflows or eutrophication from rivers and streams after heavy rain is no longer an option. To keep Richmond's predicted growth sustainable and to protect valuable arable land for food production means Richmond needs quality high density housing to prevent urban sprawl impinging on productive land.</p> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">If you could change one thing affecting the rural community during your term in office, what would it be?</span></h5> 
<p>To advocate Council sticks to its sustainable outcomes advocated in the LTP and champion sustainability for all future decisions made so we aren't paying the price for bad decision making going forward. Intensive farming is justified as the way forward for food security on our fertile Waimea Plains, however not all intensive farming practices are for food crops, so when promoting the dam as necessary for food security the community needs to decide if sustainable intensive farming can be a reality in our region.</p>

        <title>Rural Women at ACWW world conference in India 19-Sep-2013</title>
        <date>Thursday, September 19, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/A01-india-conference-web.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/A01-india-conference-web.jpg" style="float: left;"> Seven Rural Women New Zealand members, including national president Liz Evans, are in Chennai in India for the 27th Triennial Conference of the Associated Country Women of the World (ACWW).</p> 
<p>With a membership spanning 70 countries, ACWW world conferences are always colourful and enriching experiences.</p> 
<p>“Despite language and cultural differences, we have the common ground of being rural women with shared challenges and experiences,” says Liz Evans. </p> 
<p>Prime Minister John Key has written a message which will be delivered by Mrs Evans, conveying best wishes for an enjoyable and constructive conference. </p> 
<p>He says, “Women play a vital part in our rural communities and are often the key advocates who communicate community needs to local and central government.”</p> 
<p>The conference will discuss a resolution put forward by Rural Women on maternal health. We are calling on member societies to urge their governments to provide a well trained and resourced quality maternity health service, and to improve maternal health education for all women and girls to ensure the best outcomes for mothers and babies.</p> 
<p>Resolutions from other groups cover a broad spectrum of concerns, including a call to stop the practice of female genital mutilation and circumcision; asking governments to banish the use of the chemical Bisphenol A (BPA); and for the recording of all births to ensure children are recognised as citizens.</p> 
<p>The theme of the conference is Empowering Women Worldwide: Encourage, Educate, Enrich. This is also linked to the UN Millennium Development Goal that all children are entitled to a primary education. </p> 
<p>In support of this, Rural Women members will present 250 English reading books for school children in Chennai. Money for this gift was raised by Rural Women members during our Women Walk the World project, which saw 25 groups taking part in sponsored walks in April this year.</p> 
<p>Access to books is so important for education, and we’re also taking along stationery items for local children. We hear that some are so keen to learn that they work part of the day in a quarry before attending school,” says Mrs Evans.</p> 
<p>The conference begins on 26 September and runs through to 2 October. During the conference delegates will also elect a new board and the new World President will be announced, following a three year term of office of current World President, May Kidd.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Leptospirosis presentation 07-Oct-2013</title>
        <date>Monday, October 07, 2013</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Massey Lepto scientists_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 100px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> The latest on leptospirosis will be revealed on 23 October, when Massey University researchers come to Wellington to talk about the ways the disease is affecting farmers, dogs and livestock, as well as production in sheep and beef.</p> 
<p>Rural Women NZ has organised the event, where Massey's Prof. Cord Heuer, Dr Julie Collins-Emerson and Dr Jackie Benschop will talk about their latest work on lepto both here and overseas.</p> 
<p>The Massey Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences is building an international profile as a leader in leptospirosis, and has been working in Fiji, Brazil, Nepal and Sri Lanka, as well as in New Zealand.</p> 
<p>Anyone who would like to attend the presentation on 23 October should contact Rural Women New Zealand (04) 473 5524. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Leptospirosis is a global disease, but New Zealand has one of the highest rates in the world.</p> 
<p>Rural Women NZ has had a long involvement in leptospirosis research, helping to raise awareness of the animal-human link - ie how stock having the disease affects farming families and others, and how humans are affected when they catch the disease from animals, which is spread through bacteria in urine.</p> 
<p>On the farm leptospirosis can lead to loss of income when production drops, as well as the need to replace sick animals. These economic costs on already stretched budgets lead to huge stresses within affected farming families.</p> 
<p>The disease in humans can be extremely serious or even deadly, and due to the way it is spread, is a key health risk for rural families. &nbsp;The Massey team will also be talking about their work on diagnostic tests for acute human disease and on how the risk of contracting the disease can be reduced.</p> 
<p>Rural Women NZ has raised significant funds for leptospirosis research by Massey University since the 1970s through to today. &nbsp;<a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=147519">Read more</a>.</p>

        <title>Public access champion recognised 08-Oct-2013</title>
        <date>Tuesday, October 08, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/blog-publicaccesschampion.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/blog-publicaccesschampion.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; width: 300px; height: 160px; margin-right: 15px;">More than 100 people a week walk the Cable Bay Walkway, which was set up in 1984 by the Stuart family, who granted access across their farm near Nelson.</p> 
<p>Now Rural Women NZ member Barbara Stuart and her husband Ian have been recognised for their significant contribution towards improving public access to New Zealand’s outdoors.</p> 
<p>They were recently honoured as public access champions at the inaugural NZ Walking Access Commission Awards in Wellington.</p> 
<p>NZ Walking Access Commission Chairman John Forbes said “Their monumental efforts over many years have helped create the access we enjoy today and will no doubt play a major role in ensuring future generations continue to enjoy the same.”</p> 
<p>The Stuarts were one of the first private landowners to create a formal public walkway across their farm when Ian’s father established the Cable Bay Walkway 30 years ago.</p> 
<p>“Ian and Barbara have continued that spirit of goodwill and embody the values many of us grew up with. Their belief in stewardship and willingness to share the section of our country that they inhabit is something to be admired,” Mr Forbes said.</p> 
<p>Other 2013 award winners are Wellington and Dunedin legal advisor and author Brian Hayes and Dunedin public access advocate Alan McMillan.</p> 
<p>Rural Women NZ has had a close association with the NZ Walking Access Commission since it was set up five years ago, initially as a foundation stakeholder group from the rural landowner perspective.</p> 
<p>We also support the Commission’s project to supply signs for landholders to mark public access routes when crossing private property. For more on the Walking Access Signage project, <a href="http://www.walkingaccess.govt.nz/signage-project/" target="_blank">visit the website</a>.</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><br> </span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">As a member of the steering committee that will liaise directly with the UN, Rural Women NZ has hosted the first&nbsp;meeting in Wellington to start the planning process.&nbsp; </span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><br> </span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"> </p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Convened by Organic Systems and Adams Harman, others taking part in the meeting included DairyNZ, Horticulture New Zealand, the New Zealand Farm Forestry Association, Young Farmers, Beef+Lamb NZ, Federated Farmers and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Family farming has been the backbone of New Zealand’s rural economy for more than a century and Rural Women NZ has led advocacy and growth for farming families and rural communities since 1925. &nbsp;So we're very keen to mark this UN year and showcase the ongoing importance of family farming for all New Zealanders. &nbsp;For most provincial areas, economic prosperity is still dependent on the results of food production and innovation achieved by families.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Rural Women NZ has teamed up with family farming ambassador and 2013 Landcorp agricultural communicator of the year Doug Avery to run events in rural and urban centres around the country next March and April.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">“We want to celebrate family farming past, present and future,” says Mrs Evans.&nbsp; “It’s also a great opportunity to link town and country.”</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Rural Women NZ</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">will hold events across New Zealand including,</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">seminars, hands-on workshops and a photo and video competition, as well as entertainment and market-day stalls.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Other rural organisations</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">are welcome<span style="color: red;"> </span>to</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">join forces with Rural Women NZ, ensuring a programme of activities that will offer something for everyone.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">A further meeting with participants from a wide range of family farming organisations and those who work with them will be held in Wellington in November.</span></p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"> </p> 
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">The aim of the UN International Year of Family Farming is to stimulate sustainable agriculture from the perspective of combating poverty and hunger, and rural development based on respect for the environment and biodiversity.</span></p>

        <title>Enterprising Rural Woman Lisa Harper in print 09-Oct-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, October 09, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/The Wharf at Waterfall Bay_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/The Wharf at Waterfall Bay_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Rural Women NZ is thrilled to promote a new book by our Enterprising Rural Women Award winner, Lisa Harper, <strong>The Wharf at Waterfall Bay,</strong> which is dedicated to our organisation.</p> 
<p>Lisa was interviewed recently by Kim Hill on <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player/2570106">National Radio</a>. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: #445566;">For a sneak preview of the book<a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=148373"> click here</a>.</span></p> 
<p><span style="line-height: 14px; color: #445566;">Lisa's fascinating autobiography tells the story of her return to the family farm at the head of the remote Mahau Sounds, after years working overseas as a scientist, where she showed all the pluck and entrepreneurship of earlier generations of women in her family to help turn around their failing fortunes.</span></p> 
<p> The isolation didn't deter her from starting a new business. After all, her grandmother and mother were made of stern stuff, coping with running stock, keeping an orchard, securing a commercial fishing quota, making cheese, operating a guest house, home-schooling children and only getting to ‘town' on a treacherous road every six weeks.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br> <br> Eight years later Lisa is an award winning traditional cheesemaker with her own small herd of goats and cows.</p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: #445566;">She had to become innovative in her business to make it a viable proposition, and in recognition of that was awarded our Enterprising Rural Women Award in 2011.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: #445566;">Late in 2012 came another honour – the coveted Nuffield Scholarship, a prestigious award given each year to a small number of individuals around the Commonwealth who have been identified as future leaders.&nbsp; During 2013 the scholarship has taken Lisa all over the world, and it underpins her view of herself as someone who is obliged to make a difference.&nbsp; There is no doubt that she will.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: #445566;">To purchase your copy of <strong>The Wharf at Waterfall Bay</strong>, go to our <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/shop">online shop</a>. &nbsp;It's a great read!</span></p>

        <title>Police target motorists speeding past school buses 09-Oct-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, October 09, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Police enforcement banner_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Police enforcement banner_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Motorists in the Ashburton&nbsp; district&nbsp;are&nbsp;warned that police will be ticketing drivers who flaunt the 20Km/h legal speed limit - in both directions - when passing a school bus that’s stopped for children to get on or off.</p> 
<p>The police enforcement operation, timed to coincide with the start of the new school term, is a crucial part of a national school bus 20k signs trial being implemented in the Ashburton district. </p> 
<p>The trial aims to find ways of tackling the problem of poor driver awareness of the speed limit around school buses and the need for drivers to slow right down to keep children safe. Tragically, failure to do so has had dire consequences over the last 26 years, with 23 children killed and 47 seriously injured after being struck by vehicles.</p> 
<p>Sergeant Stephen Burgerhout of the Ashburton police says, “Motorists should expect to see the police enforcing the 20Km/h rule past school buses on local bus routes.”</p> 
<p>There will be serious outcomes for drivers who don’t observe the law, he warns.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>“The police have no option but to suspend a motorist’s licence for 28 days if they are travelling past a school bus at 50Km/h over the legal 20Km/h limit.”</p> 
<p>And if a driver is caught passing a stopped school bus travelling at speeds of over 70Km/h they can expect a summons to appear in court.</p> 
<p>The enforcement campaign is the third stage of a year-long trial being conducted by TERNZ Ltd, with funding from the Road Safety Trust and support from the NZ Transport Agency, Rural Women NZ and the Ashburton District Council.</p> 
<p>The trial kicked off in June with a concerted effort to raise driver awareness of the legal speed limit.&nbsp; For the last few months drivers in the Ashburton district have been bombarded with &nbsp;the ‘<strong>Either Way It’s 20K</strong>’ message through billboards, posters, advertising and wide media coverage.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>The second stage involved the installation of the LED 20Km/h signs on local school buses in August.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>These signs automatically light up when the bus door opens, and include flashing ‘wig wag’ lights to alert drivers that a bus is stopping and of the need to slow to 20Km/h.</p> 
<p>Ashburton was chosen as the location for the trial thanks to the support and co-operation of bus operator, Pearsons’ Coachlines, which services 16 schools in the district.&nbsp; Its fleet of 30 buses has been fitted with the active 20K signs, front and back.</p> 
<p>The campaign also has the strong backing of Rural Women New Zealand. We helped conduct a pre-trial survey, highlighting very low driver awareness of the 20Km/h road code rule.</p>]]></body>

        <title>International Day of Rural Women - 15 October 14-Oct-2013</title>
        <date>Monday, October 14, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Rural Women delegates at ACWW conference_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Rural Women delegates at ACWW conference_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 112px; float: left; margin-right: 11px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 15 October marks the <strong>International Day of Rural Women</strong>, a United Nations day that recognises the contribution of women in enhancing agricultural and rural development, improving food security and eradicating poverty.</p> 
<p>In line with this, seven Rural Women NZ members have just returned from an enriching and rewarding experience connecting with village women near the Indian city of Chennai.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The group was attending the triennial world conference of the Associated Countrywomen of the World (ACWW), an organisation with a worldwide membership of over a million that has had consultative status at the United Nations since 1949.</p> 
<br> 
<p>But it was meeting the rural women of India that had most impact.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Our national president, Liz Evans, says "The women, many of whom worked in the rice paddies, were so hospitable and so keen to tell us about their everyday lives, their aspirations and family ambitions.&nbsp; None of them had many financial resources, but, through project based aid organisations, like ACWW, they were able to demonstrate their successes – especially around establishing small businesses.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>At the conference, which was attended by about 500 women from around the world, Rural Women NZ’s resolution calling for “well trained and resourced quality maternity services and best outcomes for mother and baby, giving particular regard to the special needs and isolation of rural women” was adopted unanimously.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Other adopted resolutions included a call to ban the use of the “hazardous” chemical Bisphenol A (BPA), which is used in many plastic products; the need for governments to record the births of all children to ensure they are recognised as citizens, and a call to stop the practice of female genital mutilation, female circumcision and cutting, which endangers the health and lives of young girls.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Members are expected to take these adopted resolutions back to their home countries and advocate for their governments to action them.</p> 
<br> 
<p>‘Grow locally, benefit globally’&nbsp; was the theme of the&nbsp; women in agriculture workshop, where some speakers expressed concern at the large increase in heart disease, diabetes and obesity as a result of changing diets. What to do with the growing volumes of food waste was also a hot topic.</p> 
<br> 
<p>ACWW has been leading on water issues for many years, funding and supporting water storage and purifying projects in many countries. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Recognising the importance of education to help raise families out of poverty, Rural Women NZ members gave $1000 of books to local Indian school children, with funds raised earlier in the year at our ‘Women Walk the World’ events.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Ruth Shanks from Dubbo, Australia was elected as the new ACWW World President and Margaret Sullivan of Western Australia was elected as the new South Pacific Area President.</p>

        <title>Local Body Elections 2013 - Rural Women get results! 15-Oct-2013</title>
        <date>Tuesday, October 15, 2013</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/ivoteNZ_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/ivoteNZ_New.jpg" style="padding: 3px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; float: left;">Congratulations to the Rural Women members who have won council and DHB seats in the 2013 local body elections. &nbsp;Preliminary results show at least 14 members will be serving their communities for the next three years.</p> 
<p style="font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Rural Women National President, Liz Evans, says, "We congratulate these members who have stepped up to ensure that the rural voice is heard. There needs to be strong rural representation on councils, particularly those councils that act as unitary authorities.&nbsp; Services supplied and rating are very different for rural and urban people.”</span></p> 
<p style="font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Many provincial local authority areas have lost their ward&nbsp;voting opportunities, which can make it much harder for the more isolated farming areas to be represented on urban-based councils. &nbsp;We see this even in the provinces, which rely for their prosperity on their primary producer ratepayers.</span></p> 
<p style="font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">“I am sure these successful candidates will help to raise awareness of rural issues and promote better understanding and fairer outcomes for everyone.”</span></p> 
<p style="font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Several Rural Women members also stood successfully for District Health Board positions.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p style="font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">With rural health outcomes being affected by distance and access to services, it's so important that people who have a real understanding of the issues are able to advocate for rural communities when funding priorities are set and service decisions are made.</span></p>

        <title>Rural Women NZ Journalism Award 22-Oct-2013</title>
        <date>Tuesday, October 22, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/blog-journalismaward2013.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/blog-journalismaward2013.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 300px; height: 160px; margin-right: 15px; float: left;"><strong>New kids on the block take out Rural Women NZ Journalism Award</strong></p> 
<br> 
<p>The joint winners of this year’s Rural Women NZ Journalism award are Sarah Perriam and Tony Glynn of Rural Media (pictured left with Jackie Edkins, Rural Women NZ in the middle). </p> 
<br> 
<p>The Rural Women award was one of twelve awards for rural journalism and photography presented at the Guild of Agricultural Journalists’ annual dinner in Wellington on Friday evening.</p>

<p>“Our award sets out to encourage journalism that recognises the important contribution women make either to the farming sector or to rural communities,” says Rural Women NZ national president, Liz Evans. “We congratulate Sarah and Tony, who are offering a fresh approach to producing and sharing stories about rural life, through video as well as broadcast TV.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>Sarah Perriam works on the production side, while Tony Glynn directs, acts and presents programmes for Rural Media, under its Rural TV banner. Their aim is to make rural folk way more famous.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Sarah Perriam says, “Being newbies and to take out an award first time entering was a real honour, and being acknowledged by your peers in the rural media field.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>“We are big supporters of Rural Women, and for it to be that award specifically was very special, especially as the shows we entered told the stories of two very deserving women in their own right.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>The winning stories were from the Rural TV PGG Wrightson stud breeders’ series. The first covered a merino breeding programme at Nine Mile Station in Otago, focusing on sheep classer Jayne Rive. The second was about Pip Wilson, a sheep breeder at Montana Perendales in Southland.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The Guild of Agricultural Journalists’ supreme journalism award, the TBFree New Zealand Rongo Award, went to Susan Murray of Radio NZ’s Country Life programme.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The key objectives of the Guild awards are the encouragement and recognition of excellence in agricultural journalism. </p>

        <title>Rural Women NZ delighted with rural delivery service 23-Oct-2013</title>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><em>"Well done!!&nbsp;Commonsense at&nbsp;last.<br> &nbsp;I felt for all rural people but especially our mail men and women who often go well beyond their core roles and it was their livelihoods that were going to be drastically affected as well&nbsp;by the proposed changes.&nbsp;Keep up&nbsp;the good work."</em></span></p>

<p><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; color: #444444; background-color: #dfe2e7;"></em></p> 
<em> <p style="display: inline !important;">"This is a great result! Well done to all who were part of the submission."</p> </em> 
<div>
 <em> "I was delighted when I opened my mail and I have a message from Federated Farmers and from you telling me that we will have mail five days a week.&nbsp; Absolutely delighted.&nbsp; Well done." </em> 
 <div> 
  <p style="font-style: italic;">"I am so thrilled to receive this email tonight re the Postal Service in rural areas.- I feel so elated that I took the time to complete the survey especially after reading your email. It just proves that completing surveys really works and a huge thank you to everyone in your organisation.

  <p style="font-style: italic;">"Well done - great news.&nbsp; Our mail man will also be pleased."</p> 
  <p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">"Congratulations well done girls it is such a vital service."</span></p> 
  <p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"></span></p> 
  <p>"The members of the Rerewhakaaitu Branch are delighted with this news. Special thanks must go to the people in our organisation who have been so diligent in putting the case for rural communities. &nbsp;Now we must make the most of the 'win'.</p> 
  <p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><br> </span></p> 
  <p><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Liz Evans our national president, speaking on <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ruralnews/audio/2573885/morning-rural-news-for-24-october-2013">National Radio</a>, about the rural delivery reprieve.<br> </span></p> 
 </div> 
 <h5 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #4bacc6;">What it means:</span></h5> 
 <p>Under the updated deed, urban areas may see a reduction to a three day mail service from 2015, but the five day a week rural delivery service will remain unchanged, except on runs that already have a lower frequency.</p> 
 <p>“In our submission, which Minister Amy Adams has acknowledged, we highlighted that the rural delivery is so much more than just a mail service and anything that threatened its sustainability would have widespread unintended consequences,” says Rural Women national president, Liz Evans. </p> 
 <p>“It is a wraparound distribution service that is part of the fabric that holds rural communities together.</p> 
 <p>“Our rural delivery contractors provide a lifeline, delivering supplies, repairs and spare parts, animal health remedies, medicines, and courier parcels.</p> 
 <p>“The five day service ensures people are able to run their farming enterprises and other rural businesses effectively, even from remote locations.”</p> 
 <p>Rural delivery contractors also pick up mail and parcels, meaning that it’s feasible to run a production-based business from a rural location. These businesses breathe life into rural communities, as we have seen through our Enterprising Rural Women Awards. Rural Women NZ’s plea to preserve the existing rural delivery service was also based on the limitations of other communications facilities, that urban people take for granted.</p> 
 <p>“In many rural areas there is limited or no cellphone coverage and we are still dealing with dial-up connections in many cases.”</p> 
 <h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Postman Pat-on-the Back Awards</span></h5> 
 <p>Last year we ran a competition, asking you to nominate your favourite rural delivery contractor, and telling us how they go the extra mile. &nbsp;We heard some wonderful stories, and it's worth sharing them again now as we celebrate the news that this service we value so much has been saved.</p>

        <title>Outward Bound scholarship recipient, Miranda Higgins 25-Oct-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, October 25, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/OB2013_Miranda.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/OB2013_Miranda.jpg" style="float: left;"> Thanks to a scholarship provided by Outward Bound for Rural Women New Zealand members, Miranda Higgins was able to attend a recent course. She shares her story with us. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Outward Bound is truly an experience of a lifetime, and one which I have wanted to participate in since teenage days. I finally got my break in October to attend the ‘Discovery’ course designed for 40+ ‘ers. We had 9 in our group and for 8 days we were challenged with sailing, kayaking, rock climbing, high ropes, tramping, swimming, reflection etc. – (I can’t divulge it all, so some secrets are held, for those who are inspired to go)! Days were long and nights short so we jammed in the maximum experience and all had an awesome time. The Outward Bound instructors and facilities are 1st class and their day to day operations super impressive.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Everyone on the course made huge efforts to get there as life is always busy, but that makes it all the sweeter when there is an amazing experience at the end. If you have thought it may be worth a look, go for it as it is a great confidence builder. It well exceeded my expectations and has refreshed my zest for the outdoors and the need to share it with my family. HUGE THANKS to Rural Women New Zealand for their assistance with a scholarship enabling me to attend OB and meet a long held dream.</p>

        <title>Freshwater Management 08-Nov-2013</title>
        <date>Friday, November 08, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Freshwater-story.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Freshwater-story.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 4px;">On 7 November, the Ministry for the Environment held a press conference to release the new National Objectives Framework around freshwater management. The consultation process is open until 4 February and the discussion document can be found by <a href="http://www.consultation.mfe.govt.nz/content/proposed-amendments-national-policy-statement-freshwater-management-2011" target="_blank">following this link</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>There are some very good things included in this new document, including community collaboration on local values of food security, food production, drinking water, and recreational use in terms of social importance. These are not required to be monitored, unless your local community decides the value of them is high and should be.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>From a national level, two major things will be monitored by councils, and they &nbsp;are:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li>protect indigenous ecosystems</li> 
 <li>protect human health</li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<p>Within each of these there will be science-based monitoring of specific levels of, say, nitrogen and phosphorous. The main point of this framework is there will be quite a bit of community collaboration in order to set values for your local waterways.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>For a more in-depth look at this, you can watch the video below, or visit the <a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/water/freshwater/nps-freshwater-management-amendment-proposals.html" target="_blank">Ministry for the Environment's website.</a>&nbsp;We would encourage communities to take part in the travelling workshops to be conducted (dates also found on their website).</p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural Women will conduct a survey of our members later on in December.&nbsp;</p>

        <title>Vet Students at Low Risk of Getting Leptospirosis 11-Nov-2013</title>
        <date>Monday, November 11, 2013</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Massey Lepto scientists_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Massey Lepto scientists_New.jpg" style="color: #444444; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">A study into lepto in vet students at Massey, partly funded by Rural Women NZ, has shown students were at a low risk of contracting lepto, despite frequent exposure to potential sources of infection. &nbsp;It's all helped paint a picture of the broader occupational risks. &nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1mUH3rd">More</a></p> 
<p>The December 2013 of VetScript, NZVA's publication, included a major feature on Leptospirosis - 14 articles including lepto as a family issue, by Rural Women NZ. &nbsp;You can read the articles <a href="http://www.sciquest.org.nz/elibrary/edition/7206">here</a>.</p> 
<span style="color: #4bacc6;"><br> </span> 
<h5><span style="color: #4bacc6;">Some stand out statistics:</span></h5> 
<ul> 
 <li>Leptospirosis is the most prevalent occupationally-acquired zoonotic disease in New Zealand, affecting mainly the rural workforce and abattoir workers. </li> 
 <li>It can be passed from any infected mammal to humans through bacteria in the urine. </li> 
 <li>There were 113 notified cases affecting New Zealanders in 2012 with half of these hospitalised. The notified cases are the tip of the iceberg. </li> 
 <li>Based on studies in occupations at risk , modelling and notified cases, it is estimated there are 4,712 cases a year in rural, compared with 189 in urban areas, demonstrating the significant burden lepto places on New Zealanders.</li> 
 <li>13% of abattoir workers, 4.6% of vets and 5% of farmers have been exposed to this infection. </li> 
 <li>The annual financial cost of working days lost and treatment in New Zealand is estimated at $30.4 million.</li> 
 <li>Loss of livestock production due to disease and mortalities - and in some species sub-optimal growth or reproductive performance - adds to the economic cost.</li> 
 <li>There is a high level of vaccination of dairy cows in NZ, primarily to protect worker health; but vaccination timing is all important. A pilot study showed that early vaccination appears to be a key factor in reducing lepto shedding in long-term vaccinated dairy herds. Further work is under way at Massey to provide farmers with recommendations on best practice for lepto vaccination. </li> 
 <li>Farm working dogs are also at risk of infection and severe disease, and may not be well protected by currently available vaccines</li>

        <title>Rural Women NZ elects new national president 26-Nov-2013</title>
        <date>Tuesday, November 26, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/blog-president2013.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/blog-president2013.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 300px; height: 160px; margin-right: 15px; float: left;">Wendy McGowan has been elected as the new national president of Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Her success was announced at the organisation’s AGM held in Wellington today, attended by 80 members from around the country.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Wendy McGowan previously served a three-year term as national vice president, and has been the national councillor for Bay of Plenty/Coromandel for the last six years, taking a special interest in land use issues, bio-security and food safety.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Wendy told members, “As national president I will build on our organisation’s goals and aspirations to be dynamic, vibrant, leading, innovative and visible at all levels.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“Rural Women NZ’s interest in land, health, education and community issues need our attention and advocacy, just as they did in the 1920s.As then, encouraging women living in rural communities to voice their concerns and support one another is what we do well.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>Wendy immediately announced the appointment of Kerry Maw, the national councillor for Canterbury, as her vice president.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Looking ahead, Wendy says it is exciting to be taking a leading role in plans to celebrate the UN International Year of Family Farming in 2014. The organisation is planning a series of events in March and April around the country to highlight the important role of family farms in provincial economic prosperity.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“It’s also an opportunity to strengthen links and understanding between rural and urban.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>The AGM was officially opened by Rural Women NZ’s patron, Her Excellency, Lady Janine Mateparae, who said her decision to take on the patron role was made easier by the organisation’s commitment to provide a voice for rural women and rural families, and our work is extremely important to the continued good health of the rural sector and New Zealand.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Prime Minister John Key also spoke at the opening ceremony and answered questions from the floor.</p> 
<br> 
<p>He said there are significant differences between our urban and rural communities and the key question is how we make sure those differences and issues are understood by everybody. He cited broadband access, the volatility of weather that farmers must cope with and schooling in rural areas as key challenges.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Wendy McGowan and her husband Rusty farm a 260 hectare dairy support unit in Kaharoa in the Bay of Plenty. She is also an enrolled nurse and works as a casual play specialist at Rotorua Hospital’s Children’s Unit.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Rural Women also announced Mary McTavish - Bay of Plenty/Coromandel (Region 5), and Fiona Gower - Top of the North Island (Region7), as new national councillors.&nbsp;</p>]]></body>

        <title>Rural Women NZ helps launch International Year of Family Farming at Parliament 28-Nov-2013</title>
        <date>Thursday, November 28, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/blog/IMG_1817.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/IMG_1817.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 0px 3px 0px 0px;">Rural Women New Zealand played a leading role in today’s launch at Parliament of the International Year of Family Farming 2014 (IYFF 2014), to coincide with the global launch at the United Nations headquarters in New York.</p> 
<br> 
<p>As one of five members of the national steering committee, Rural Women New Zealand has helped bring together a broad cross-section of groups from the agricultural sector.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Representatives of fifty organisations met at Parliament to gather information about the key issues facing family farming, develop plans for research and actions based on this information, and agree on programme outline for IYFF 2014.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Today’s workshops highlighted some of the challenges facing family farms, including succession planning and the price of land, establishment costs and the need to upgrade plant and machinery to remain competitive in an evolving market. </p> 
<br> 
<p>“The need to upskill and stay abreast of developments in the areas of financial literacy, international commodity prices and compliance was also raised,” says Rural Women NZ executive officer, Noeline Holt.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“The International Year of Family Farming is a soft landing place to talk about the hard issues, so they can be discussed within the sector with a focus on solutions.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand has already started planning its own celebrations for IYFF 2014, teaming up with family farming ambassador and 2013 Landcorp agricultural communicator of the year Doug Avery to run events next March and April.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<br.> 
 <p>Through the Royal Agricultural Society, we have confirmed A&amp;P showground venues at Stratford, Carterton, Motueka, Rangiora and Ashburton. Further events are planned for Auckland, Wellington Christchurch and Dunedin, to help strengthen links between town and country.</p> 
 <br> 
 <p>“We want to celebrate family farming past, present and future,” says Noeline Holt.</p> 
 <br> 
 <p>The programme will include seminars, hands-on workshops and a photo and video competition, as well as entertainment and market-day stalls.</p> 
 <br>

        <title>Home health industry 04-Dec-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, December 04, 2013</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>At our AGM on 25 November, Graeme Titcombe, CEO of Access Homehealth, had some concerning messages in his presentation on the crisis facing the homecare sector and the urgent need for action.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Here are 5 key messages to take away:</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<ol> 
 <li>There needs to be realistic funding from Government for the fair travel policy, which has not been increased since it was introduced as a partial reimbursement in 2005. At the moment, care workers - particularly in rural areas - are substantially subsidising the cost of travelling to their clients.</li> 
 <li>There is currently no funding for travel time, which has a particular impact on rural caregivers.</li> 
 <li>The Government needs to address the issues raised in the document Caring Counts around pay equity in a proactive way, rather than waiting for court cases on the issue. If the Government doesn't take a proactive stance, homecare services are going to fail in 2014.</li> 
 <li>A real threat will be the next minimum wage increase. No DHB has passed on an increase in the minimum wage to the homecare providers from the last three increases.</li> 
 <li>While there has been more money put into the sector, this has only kept up with the increase in volume as the population ages.</li> 
</ol> 
<br> 
<p>Stay tuned for more information as it comes out early next year. If you're looking for in depth information on the sector, visit <a href="http://http://www.nzhha.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZ Home Health Association</a>.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/TeKura.jpg" style="float: left; width: 280px; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px;">Rural Women New Zealand has been involved with Te Kura (formerly The Correspondence School) for decades. The Rural Women New Zealand Golden Jubilee Prize began for general excellence and attitude to schoolwork for a student living in a remote area.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>National President Wendy McGowan and Executive Officer Noeline Holt attended the awards on 4 December 2013 in Wellington. Didi Hughes and Jack Williams were awarded the RWNZ prize this year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Didi is a year 12 student living in Tokomaru Bay, where she helps her parents run a small B&amp;B while still completing all her work on time and of a high standard. She shows a real knack for horticulture - she has a productive vegetable garden; and writing - receiving runner up in the National Secondary School Poetry competition earlier this year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Jack is a year 8 student from the isolated rural area surrounding Manganoui. He excels in mathematics and science, earning 16 credits in maths at level 1 and a further 12 numeracy credits in his science programme; both awarded with either Merit or Excellence. These skills have been translated into building a great working model of a marble drop.</p>

        <title>Hot Chick! Beverley Forrester 17-Dec-2013</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/Beverley Forrester.jpg" style="float: left;">Glenmark Dinner Group member, Beverley Forrester, came down to earth with a bump after "wowing" the crowd at 2013 NZ Fashion Week in September. She was the first person in Australasia to have a handknit wool collection on an international catwalk.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>After working with international models and the media, conducting TV interviews, and having her <em><a href="http://www.nzfashionweek.co.nz/designer-bevriverina" target="_blank">Beverley Riverina</a></em> collection televised in 156 countries, Beverley returned home to Hawarden to 250km/h winds, trees down, power poles smashed in half, no power for four days and no landline for a week.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>"I went from catwalk gal to chopping firewood as a pioneer woman within 5 days!" said Beverley. At NZ Fashion Week, she also had the honour of being selected by BMW as one of three 'New Generation' designers, who had personal wrap designs reflecting their brands put on three BMW vehicles that led the official fleet used to transport VIPs around Auckland City.</p>

        <title>Three Christmas Wishes from Rural Women New Zealand 18-Dec-2013</title>
        <date>Wednesday, December 18, 2013</date>
        <img>/images/E-newsletter/Christmas2013_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/E-newsletter/Christmas2013.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="/images/E-newsletter/Christmas2013_New.jpg" style="float: left;"></a>Rural Women New Zealand wishes everyone a happy holiday season! We thought we'd share our three Christmas wishes for 2013.</p> 
<ol> 
 <li><strong>Ask for help</strong> – 2013 has been a year when pressures and anxiety levels of rural and farming life attracted close attention, says Rural Women NZ National President, Wendy McGowan. “From January we begin a campaign highlighting access to rural health and well-being services. Help can be the best gift of all.” Members of RWNZ will also continue fundraising during 2014 to provide adverse events counselling opportunities for individuals and communities.</li> 
 <br> 
 <li><strong>Give family violence a permanent holiday</strong> - everyone should be safe at home. Women’s Refuge NZ says most refuges experience a spike in demand during the festive season. But, fewer than half are equipped to take care of rural families in a crisis. Due to isolation, those feeling unsafe may have to seek immediate help from others nearby. This can result in concerns about anonymity and confidentiality. “For many rural women, their home is also their business base”, says Mrs McGowan. “If she needs to escape a violent situation, she leaves behind her home, community, job and animals.”<br> <br> The NZ RSPCA/NCWR 2012 “Pets as Pawns” research found that cows were fourth in the hierarchy of animals most likely to be killed by a violent partner, following dogs, cats and birds. “This raises serious animal welfare issues. The Pets as Pawns survey reported that violent partners used threats to companion and farm production animals as ways of controlling and intimidating family members.”<br> <br> Rural Women and Are you OK campaign will launch a letterbox sticker campaign to focus on supporting each other in rural communities. Look for this in rural mail in 2014.&nbsp;<br> <span style="background-color: #dfe2e7;"><br> <br> </span></li> 
 <li> Women’s Refuge operates a 24 hour crisis helpline service – 0800 733843 every day of the year. The crime prevention organisation, Crimestoppers (0800 555 111), also guarantees caller anonymity. </li> 
 <br> 
 <li><strong>Universal mobile phone coverage</strong> – a recent RWNZ survey found that one-third of respondents did not have mobile phone coverage on their properties or on the public roads leading to them.<br> <br> “Many visitors to rural areas this summer will be surprised how patchy and variable cell-phone coverage is,’ says Mrs McGowan. This lack of a NZ-wide communication option that most consumers now take for granted can cause frustration and anxiety – especially when accidents, illness and crime occur.<br> <br> “RWNZ will continue in 2014 to raise the bar for rural technology coverage – including broadband, but, especially advocating for greater cellphone coverage which we see as a health and safety necessity,” Mrs McGowan said. </li>

        <title>2014 is the UN International Year of Family Farming 16-Jan-2014</title>
        <date>Thursday, January 16, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/The Bitches Box for website.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/The Bitches Box for website.jpg" style="width: 400px;"></p> 
<p>What better excuse do we need to celebrate our rural roots and futures than a United Nations proclamation of an international year in honour of family farming?</p> 
<br> 
<p>Family farms are the backbone of our rural communities built up over a century and a half. And family farms are just as important to the economy now as ever.</p> 
<br> 
<p>And being an international event, we’re also recognising the importance of family farms worldwide, with over two billion of the world’s human beings depending on family farms for their survival. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9hryUpy6_E" target="_blank">Watch this</a> great piece from Food Tank.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The UN International Year of Family Farming has some worthy goals, focusing on sustainability, food security, the eradication of hunger and malnutrition, and helping people step up out of poverty.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural Women NZ is excited to be leading celebrations in this country. Roadshows have already been held in Oamaru, Rangiora and Rai Valley. &nbsp;Coming up is Carterton (6 April) and Stratford (9 April).&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>Marlborough dry lands farmer Doug Avery, a passionate advocate for family farming and Landcorp Communicator of the Year in 2013, is launching celebrations at each venue, giving an inspirational talk on the Peaks and Valleys of rural life.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>The <strong>Landcare Trus</strong>t talks about sustainability on the farm, <strong>Coach Approach</strong> is walking us through the tricky steps involved in succession planning and transitioning to the next generation, while <strong>WorkSafe</strong> is conducting workshops on how to keep visitors safe on the farm.</p> 
<br> 
<p>At the road shows you'll be able to &nbsp;browse market stalls featuring local produce, crafts and displays.</p> 
<br> 
<p>We are celebrating New Zealand farming past, present and future, and embracing all aspects of farming from the farmer and family to the rural communities and hubs.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Each roadshow ends on a high, with a hilarious romp around the dog kennels courtesy of Kiwi performers <strong>The Bitches Box and Mel Parsons,</strong> hot from their stellar season at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p>

        <title>Heading back to school 22-Jan-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, January 22, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/DSC05643.JPG</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/DSC05643.JPG" style="width: 300px; float: right;">As children head back to school, Rural Women NZ hopes 2014 will be the year when state-of-the-art signage will be approved for use on school buses to help remind passing motorists that ‘Either Way It’s 20K’.</p> 
<br> Rural Women NZ national president, Wendy McGowan, says “The 20kmh speed limit in both directions must be one of the most flouted rules in the Road Code, often because drivers are simply unaware of the law, or don’t notice they’re passing a school bus until it’s too late. 
<div>
 <br> “We are calling for illuminated 20K signs to be approved for use on school buses.”
 <br> During 2013 Rural Women NZ took part in an extensive trial in Ashburton, along with TERNZ Ltd and NZTA, to alert drivers that they’re about to pass a school bus and of the need to slow right down, called ‘Either Way it’s 20K’.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> A key part of the trial was the installation of bright, 20K signs on the front and rear of the buses that lit up when the doors opened, and included flashing wig wag lights to attract drivers’ attention well in advance.
 <br> The three-phase trial began with an intense awareness campaign, followed by targeted police enforcement.
 <br> Wendy McGowan says, “The trial shows there’s still a way to go. &nbsp;Ashburton drivers are still passing school buses at twice the legal speed limit on average, but it’s certainly a step in the right direction.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Before the campaign began, the average speed of drivers passing a stationary school bus was 80kmh. &nbsp;Now drivers are slowing to an average of 40kmh, with a noticeable speed reduction on main roads and open rural highways.
 <br> Children are especially vulnerable in rural areas, where they are dropped off at the side of the road, often with no pavement. &nbsp;A moment’s inattention or the child’s inability to translate speed and distance has led to tragic fatalities and serious injuries year on year as children dash in front of cars and trucks.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> That’s why observing the 20kmh law is so vital. &nbsp;At that speed drivers have much longer to react, and if cars do make contact with a child, it’s unlikely to be fatal or so serious.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> TERNZ Ltd will be making its recommendations to the NZ Transport Agency in June.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Rural Women NZ strongly hopes 2014 is the year that the 20K signs are approved by the Agency, so that communities and bus companies can work together to make them a universal feature of school buses in New Zealand.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “Rural communities are right behind this campaign, and some have started fundraising for signs on their local school buses. &nbsp;We are just waiting for them to become an approved sign. &nbsp;In the long term we’d like to see 20K signs installed on all school buses throughout the country.”

        <title>AWDT 2013 graduates from RWNZ 22-Jan-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, January 22, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/Agri Women's Development Trust grads 2013.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/Agri Women's Development Trust grads 2013.jpg" style="float: left;">Six highly motivated Rural Women NZ members graduated from the Agri-Women's Development Trust Escalator course in November, after a year spent honing their skills in the areas of finance, governance and strategy, communication and leadership.</p> 
<br> 
<p>At the prestigious ceremony held in Wellington, Fiona Gower said, "At the start of the year I wasn't completely sure where it would take me, but as it went on I gained enough confidence to step up and put myself forward for a couple of roles on my local community board and the Rural Women NZ national council."</p> 
<br> 
<p>The course challenged participants to learn about themselves and realise their potential. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"The course gave me greater confidence and belief in myself, which is priceless. I really have to thank Beef+Lamb, who gave me the opportunity to attend this course through a scholarship. Without this, I do not think I would have pushed myself to attend!"</p> 
<br> 
<p>Fiona would recommend the AWDT Escalator programme for anyone considering taking on a leadership or governance role, whether in their communities or professionally. And for those just beginning their journey, the AWDT First Steps programme will give them the confidence to get started.</p>

        <title>Dates set for International Year of Family Farming Events 27-Jan-2014</title>
        <date>Monday, January 27, 2014</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<br> 
<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Official_logo_of_International_Year_of_Family_Farming_2014_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 76px; margin-right: 8px;">Rural Women NZ is forging ahead with plans to celebrate the UN International Year of Family Farming 2014.
<br> 
<br> “We are excited to be leading events around the country, with a series of road shows beginning at North Otago’s A&amp;P showgrounds in Oamaru on 27 March,” says Rural Women NZ national president, Wendy McGowan.
<br> 
<br> Similar events will be held at the A&amp;P showgrounds in Rangiora (28 March), Ashburton (29 March), Helensville (5 April), Carterton (6 April), Rai Valley (7 April) and Stratford (9 April).&nbsp;
<br> 
<br> Marlborough dry lands farmer, Doug Avery, a passionate advocate for family farming and Landcorp Communicator of the Year in 2013, will co-host the events, giving an inspirational talk on the transformation of his drought-stricken farm into a sustainable venture through visionary changes to his farming system.
<br> 
<br> Avery predicts farming families will continue to excel in New Zealand. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> “There is one reason they will do that, which is because you can’t replace passion in anything, and people that are working for themselves with their own vision have that element that is called passion, which will lead and beat pretty much anything else that corporate structures will throw at us.”
<br> 
<br> But farmers can’t operate in isolation.
<br> 
<br> “Every family needs a farmer, and every farmer needs a community,” says Wendy McGowan. “Our organisation is focused on growing dynamic communities, so celebrating the UN International Year of Family Farming is the perfect fit for us.”
<br> 
<br> Each of the road shows will have its own local flavour, including seminars on topics such as succession planning, safety on the farm, investing in your farming future and sustainability.
<br> 
<br> There’ll also be market stalls, crafts and displays by local businesses. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> And we’ll be ending the celebrations on a fun note, with a hilarious romp around the dog kennels courtesy of Kiwi performers The Bitches Box and Mel Parsons, hot from their stellar season at the Edinburgh Film Festival.
<br> 
<br> Worldwide, the UN International Year of Family Farming is focused on sustainability, food security, the eradication of hunger and malnutrition, and helping people step up out of poverty.

<p>Eleven women from around New Zealand arrive in Wellington today for the start of a three day leadership course co-ordinated by Rural Women NZ and sponsored by Landcorp.</p> 
<p>The women, all Rural Women NZ members, are active in their communities and are now looking to grow their communications skills, enhance their networks, and learn more of th</p> 
<p>e work of our organisation at a national level.</p> 
<p>“The women will explore what makes an effective leader, how to influence others and the importance of networks both within the organisation and in the broader rural sector,” says Rural Women NZ national president, Wendy McGowan.</p> 
<p>Leading this first section of the programme will be Agri-Women’s Development Trust founder, <strong>Lindy Nelson</strong>, who is also the 2013 Next Business Woman of the Year.</p> 
<p>“The women all bring strong skills to the table, and we hope this leadership programme will give them a greater understanding of the role Rural Women NZ plays at national level for the good of rural communities, and how they can be part of that,” says Mrs McGowan.</p> 
<p>On the second day, participants will meet members of both the <strong>Labour and National parties’ Women’s Caucus</strong>, and will have the opportunity to observe Parliament in action.</p> 
<p><strong>Vanisa Dhiru</strong>, chief executive of Volunteering New Zealand will share her insights into ways to inspire volunteers, while David Chrisp, general manager North Island for Access Homehealth Ltd, will be encouraging the participants to take an active role in the community through the home healthcare sector.</p> 
<p>During 2014 Rural Women NZ is partnering with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to bring <strong>the It’s OK to Ask for Help</strong> campaign to rural communities with a letterbox sticker campaign.&nbsp; Wellington-based MSD staff, Sheryl Hann and Stephanie Edmond, will present on the need to change the way New Zealanders act and think about family violence.</p> 
<p>As broadband becomes more widely available in rural communities, online communications and connectivity are becoming increasingly accessible. <strong>David Farrar</strong>, Kiwiblog founder, will talk about the possibilities social media presents for rural.</p> 
<p><strong>Landcorp</strong> will kindly host the group for lunch on the final day of the leadership course, with the opportunity for the women to network with the new CEO, Steven Carden, and other staff.</p>

        <title>Cyclone Lusi Update 14-Mar-2014</title>
        <date>Friday, March 14, 2014</date>
        <img>/Cyclone-Lusi_large.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>This could be a significant adverse weather event affecting many parts of the country.</p> 
<p><br> </p> Cyclone Lusi is expected to move southwards today (Friday), bringing widespread heavy rain and easterly gales to the North Island from tonight (Friday night), and the upper South Island during Saturday. Rain is forecast to become heavy in Northland this evening and 80-100mm are likely to have accumulated there by Saturday afternoon.
<br> 
<br> 
<div>
 The rain should spread quickly southwards, totalling more than 100mm in Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and Gisborne by Sunday morning.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> In the upper South Island, Marlborough and Nelson look set to receive the most intense rainfall, with up to 170mm accumulating in the Nelson ranges from Saturday afternoon till noon Sunday.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Easterly gales will accompany the heavy rain, with severe gusts of 120km/h in Northland, Auckland and Coromandel Peninsula, and 130km/h west of the Kaimai Range.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The heavy rain is likely to cause slips and surface flooding, and the severe easterly gales could make driving hazardous, lift roofs, and bring down trees and powerlines.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> QUICK TIPS:
</div> 
<ul> 
 <li>Talk to your neighbours about resources and needs should the worst happen</li> 
 <li>Move stock away from the expected prevailing wind direction/low lying flood prone areas</li> 
 <li>Check generators work with adequate fuel/lubricants to hand</li> 
 <li>Charge up every mobile phone you have (as long as it takes a SIM it will work)</li> 
 <li>If power does fail, use SMS text instead of voice</li> 
 <li>Top up bottles, jugs with potable water in case the storm disrupt water supplies</li> 
 <li>Check your household for torches/batteries as well as food</li> 
 <li>In case power fails, make sure your BBQ has a full bottle of gas for cooking</li> 
 <li>Ensure you have tarpaulins in case your roof lifts in high wind</li> 
 <li>Check around your property and secure loose items that become dangerous in high winds</li> 
 <li>Wait until the storm has passed to undertake any remedial/repair work. &nbsp;This includes looking for:</li> 
 <ol> 
  <li>Damaged or highly strained fence lines</li> 
  <li>Downed or leaning trees including exposed root beds and take care or call in a contractor</li> 
  <li>Damaged buildings, bridges or infrastructure</li> 
  <li>Downed power lines, or lines which are still on farm buildings or fences. &nbsp;Please treat all downed lines as LIVE.</li> 
 </ol> 
</ul>

        <title>International Year of Family Farming 2014 Roadshows inspire 24-Mar-2014</title>
        <date>Monday, March 24, 2014</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/IYFF Oamaru for website.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/IYFF Oamaru for website.jpg" alt="Oamaru International Year of Family Farming" style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19.5px; width: 292px; height: 174px; float: left; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"></p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Our International Year of Family Farming roadshows are underway, with very successful events already held in Oamaru and Rai Valley. &nbsp;Next it's on to <strong>Carterton</strong> (6 April) and <strong>Stratford </strong>(9 April)</p> 
<p>All members of the public are welcome to come along.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>The roadshows include stalls and trade stands, demonstrations, a keynote speech by Doug Avery, Landcorp Communicator of the Year in 2013, seminars, workshops and entertainment. (<em>Full details of the programme for each venue in the links below).</em></p> 
<br> 
<p>Pictured is Liz Evans (above) promoting the Marlborough event at the local library.&nbsp; She&nbsp; stresses you don’t have to be a farmer to come along to the Rural Women NZ roadshows and enjoy yourself.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"An interest in land use, families, animals, food and personal well-being is more than enough to take part."</p> 
<br> 
<p>She says Rural Women NZ has always backed families working on the land, and in the rural communities that surround them.&nbsp; </p> 
<br> 
<p>“For this reason, we were ‘first in’ to initiate a nationwide programme of events to support the UN International Year of Family Farming, a timely opportunity to celebrate the dedication and contribution of farming families, past, present and future.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>In every valley and on the plains of New Zealand, there are family-owned and operated farms. Many have been in the same family for generations, and can often be identified by local road names as people travel around New Zealand’s rural roads.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“Rural Women NZ members set a high store on family farming, especially as it tends to be these families who help contribute to the richness and spirit of community life.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“And we are seeing a renewed interest in the land by a wide range of people,” says Mrs Evans. “School children want to learn more about growing food. Teenagers are beginning to recognise a future in skilled work with animals, crops and agricultural technology, and young people already in farming families work hard for an opportunity to successfully transition to owning that farm business.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“People are beginning to think about what they can do to improve water quality, food safety and natural resources, taking a partnership approach. This can only lead to a greater sense of understanding and teamwork around farming and productivity.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>The United Nations’ aim in celebrating the year is to raise the profile of family farming and smallholder production by focusing world attention on its role in eradicating hunger, providing food security&nbsp; and managing natural resources for the benefit of all. </p> 
<br> 
<p>The goal is to reposition family farming at the centre of agricultural, environmental and social policy globally – and identify efficient ways to support family farmers. </p>

        <title>Gardening grants encourage little green fingers 02-Apr-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, April 02, 2014</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Mary McTavish at Te Ranga School2 for website.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Mary McTavish at Te Ranga School2 for website.jpg" style="margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; border-style: solid; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19.5px; width: 298px; height: 170px; float: left;"> 
<p>Mary McTavish, our national councillor for Bay of Plenty Coromandel, recently presented a cheque for $2000 to Te Ranga school – the first of 10 gardening grants being given to rural schools this year with funds raised from the Farmlands Ladies Nights.</p> 
<p>Acting Principal, Janet Blaauw, said, "I would just like to say a HUGE thank you for the gardening grant that our school received from Rural Women NZ. You all do a fabulous job of helping out rural areas!"</p> 
<div>
  Mary told the pupils at a special assembly, &nbsp;"I am most impressed with what you have already achieved in your school garden. &nbsp;Clearly there are some expert gardeners among you and I'm very pleased Te Ranga School won this year as you are already demonstrating your keen interest in growing and harvesting your produce.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The school will purchase new irrigation equipment and gardening tools with its grant.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The gardens will also get a boost thanks to sponsorship from Agrisea, which is contributing a generous quantity of their organic fertiliser product to the winning schools.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> There's a real focus in schools on children learning the value of eating fresh food and understanding where it comes from, and we're very pleased to be able to support this, especially as we celebrate the UN International Year of Family Farming.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> This is the fourth time Rural Women NZ and Farmlands have worked together to distribute the proceeds from the popular Farmlands Ladies Nights.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Other successful schools this year were Swannanoa, Waitahuna, Waihao Downs, Hororata, Mangamuka, Te Ranga, Kimbolton, Ahititi, Tahuna and Papanui, chosen from 58 applicants.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Projects lined up range from building a tunnel house to constructing a hen pen, buying equipment such as rakes, spades, seeds and plants, and building a permaculture edible food forest.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Farmlands' Events and Sponsorship Manager, Helen Shrewsbury says the company is proud to continue its support of Rural Women New Zealand and the rural school garden grants.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “As a rural co-operative, it just makes sense for us to support the schools that make up the hubs of the rural communities we service.”

<br> Rural Women NZ's letter box sticker competition is helping show our support for violence-free families. 
<div>
 <br> The competition is being run in partnership with the national It’s Not OK Campaign.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> People can show they support violence-free families by posting a sticker on their letter box encouraging us all to make our communities safer.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Then enter our competition by sending in a photo of your letter box with the sticker on it, just like the one sent in here by one of member Wendy Knight.

<h5>Did you know ...</h5> 
<div>
 <br> •
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In New Zealand 39% of women in rural areas and 33% in urban areas will experience physical or sexual violence from a partner in their lifetime
 <br> •
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Half of all murders and 58% of violent crime in New Zealand is family violence
 <br> •
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Police are called to a family violence incident every six minutes but estimate only 20% of incidents are ever reported.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Family violence can be hard to detect in rural communities where houses are far apart and victims can be more easily isolated from family and friends than in built up areas.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “It can be easy to say ‘It’s not my business’ if we are worried that violence might be happening to someone we know. &nbsp;But family violence is a crime and should be reported,” says national president, Wendy McGowan.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “As members of Rural Women NZ we can take leadership on this issue. &nbsp;We can use our profile in our communities to bring this serious social issue out into the open.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “Friends and family are usually the first people to see the signs of violence in the home and we encourage people to offer help – safely – if they are concerned.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “We say it’s better to be wrong than sorry, so act on your gut instinct. &nbsp;We don’t recommend intervening in a violent situation, but do recommend asking for help or advice or reaching out at a quiet time.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Violence is not just physical, it’s psychological, sexual, financial and emotional. Below are some signs that violence is happening in a family relationship.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<h5>A victim may be:</h5> 
<div>
 <br> •
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>fearful, nervous
 <br> •
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>isolated, doesn't want you coming round
 <br> •
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>worried about their partner's reaction
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<h5>A child may be:</h5>

        <title>Women Walk the World 2014 02-Apr-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, April 02, 2014</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/WWTW for website.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="margin-bottom: 9px; float: left; margin-right: 9px; border: 2px solid;" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/WWTW for website.jpg"><br> Wonder how many groups taking part in Women Walk the World events around the globe were accompanied by an animal?</p> 
<p>Near Whanganui, Harley the pet goat followed 13 Fordell-Mangamahu members all the way on their 12 kilometre trek over hilly terrain during their Women Walk the World day out.</p> 
<p>Setting off from a farmhouse at 190 metres above sea level, the members and Harley climbed up to 434 metres over four hours, traversing typical hill country land. &nbsp;They took their lunch with them and enjoyed the wonderful 360 degree views in perfect autumn weather. Not to be left out, three dogs also joined the hikers and Harley on their adventure.</p> 
<p>The walk was one of 30 that Rural Women NZ members took part in, combining a social day in the fresh air with fundraising for the ACWW cause. In total we raised $1,931.76. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our Forest Reserve branch members in the far north chose to do a coastal walk at Mangawhai heads. &nbsp;“Starting &nbsp;at the Sandbar Cafe they climbed the stairs to the clifftop walkway. &nbsp;“This walk mirrored the Troubadour’s Walk one of the walks in the hugely popular Mangawhai Walking Weekend held in March. &nbsp;We enjoyed the stupendous view of the Estuary and out to sea the Hen and Chicken Islands and Little Barrier on the horizon before wending our way down a track through bush on the headland to the Estuary again. &nbsp;An amble along the shore then a stiff climb up to the residential streets of Mangwhai Heads and back to the Sandbar for a drink and informal meeting. &nbsp;A total of $100 was raised from a gold coin donation for the walk and an extra special trading table. &nbsp;A fun day for a good cause.</p> 
<p>North Auckland Provincial members and some husbands and friends gathered at Butler’s Point Whaling Museum at Hi Hi beach, Mangonui, to look around the museum and walk through the beautiful old gardens of the homestead, built in 1876, including 170 year old magnolia trees, says Marilyn Hutchings, provincial president.<br> Our smallest branches weren’t going to be left out either. &nbsp;Three members from Colville in north Coromandel set off on a fine morning, riding their bikes a short distance before walking up and over the hill to Waitete Bay, where they plunged into the sea for a refreshing swim and ate lunch before retracing their footsteps back to Colville, a 16 kilometre walk in total.</p> 
<p>Omokoroa Rural Women met at Salisbury Wharf at Mt Maunganui and after an enjoyable lunch walked along the beautiful boardwalk at Pilot Bay.</p> 
<p>A larger group of 32 members explored the newly-opened Clutha Gold Trail in the South Island, which offers a unique heritage experience. The trail showcases the area’s history, including the earliest Maori moa hunters, Chinese gold miners and European-style farming. The walkers, from our Beaumont-Tuapeka group, rounded out their day’s activities with raffles to raise funds for ACWW and a well-deserved cup of tea.</p> 
<p>Other walks were held in Taranaki, at Lake Mangamahoe, Dargaville during the regional conference, Thomson’s Bush on the banks of the Waihopai River near Invercargill, at Puketi coastal garden, at Butler’s Museum Kaikohe; at the Waitahora Valley by members of the Mangatoro branch; and at Mount Maunganui, where members of Te Puke-Rotoehu branch stepped out. &nbsp;Cromwell branch members walked around Lake Hayes and lunched together in Arrowtown after their 10K hike. &nbsp;Rukuhia and Tirau branch members walked around Lake Cameron, and Rerewhakaaiti members took a stroll around a retirement village gardens. Others groups that took part included Franklin, Oropi, Hampden, North Otago Provincial, Henley, Pokuru, Naike, Auroa, Muhuinoa East, Scotts Ferry, Mahikapawa and Omokoroa branches. &nbsp;You all earned yourselves a cuppa and a big pat on the back!</p> 
<p>Once again, Rural Women New Zealand’s Women Walk the World challenge was a great success and our members are looking forward to taking part again next year.</p> 
<p>National council has agreed to donate $1000 from Women Walk the World to our Solomon Islands appeal. &nbsp;The rest will go to ACWW’s Pennies for Friendship fund. To date we have raised $1931.76. &nbsp;<br> <br> <br> </p>]]></body>

        <title>Quad bike safety 02-Apr-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, April 02, 2014</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img longdesc="Quad bike safety demo" alt="Quad bike safety demo" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/Quad bike safety day, photo Leonie Cadman for website.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;">Rural Women NZ took part in a quad bike forum from 24/25 March called by WorkSafe New Zealand, to work through the 2013 recommendations of Coroner Brandt Shortland, following his joint inquests into five quad bike related deaths.</p> 
<p>Others included in the forum include manufacturers, farming and community leaders and trainers. The focus was on making a commitment to action and working on how the Coroner’s recommendations can be implemented.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>Coroner Shortland’s recommendations were:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Quad bikes should not be referred to as ‘all-terrain vehicles’ as this is misleading;A helmet should be worn at all times</li> 
 <li>Children should be prevented from riding adult quad bikes</li> 
 <li>Comprehensive information and training is required in relation to hazard identification, maintenance checks, limitations and frailties of quad bikes, particularly when after-market attachments like spray units and trailers are attached;how to choose the right vehicle for the job and how correct tyre pressure and well maintained vehicles reduce risk, serious harm and fatalities;</li> 
 <li>Consideration should be given to setting up a multi-disciplinary taskforce to specifically research and advise on roll over protection structures.</li> 
</ul> 
<br> 
<p>The forum also considered new health and safety legislation, based on the Australian Model Law, which will replace the Health &amp; Safety in Employment Act. It will extend the duty of care to all people in the workplace, though the focus is on people conducting a business or undertaking (“PCBUs”). PCBUs will include company directors, managers and heads of department. Company officers, workers, volunteers and people employing others to do residential work are specifically excluded from being classified as PCBUs.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Beware of Online Scammers! 02-Apr-2014</title>

<p>Police are worried about elderly people being scammed online. Older rural people may be particularly vulnerable as they may not have the same opportunities to socialise and may connect with people via the internet instead.</p> 
<p>So a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs_rpOOw844">new video</a> on this type of crime and how to prevent it happening to you or someone you know has been produced by the police.</p> 
<div>
 Police tell us the sums of money leaving the country are in the millions - BNZ has a full time person tracking all funds leaving the country. If there is a concern they notify the police who visit the person and show them they are being scammed. This sometimes takes some persuasion.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> It's something to be aware of and to remind any elderly people you know to avoid responding to any emails from addresses that are unfamiliar, in particular seeking friendship, romance, your credit card details or the opportunity to make a lot of money.

<p>Rural Women NZ has a strong interest in helping women reach their full leadership potential.</p> 
<p>Each year we run a <strong>Growing Dynamic Leaders course</strong> in Wellington, sponsored by Landcorp, which offers an intensive, stimulating three day programme of speakers, activities, workshops and presentations.</p> 
<p>This year,&nbsp;Bobbie Mulgrew, Leona Trimble, Sharron Davie-Martin, Alex Thompson, Bex Warburton, Sue Hendra, Wendy Knight, June Lambeth, Vicky Appleby, Nichola Hine and Debbie Evans took part. They come from all areas of the country.<br> &nbsp;<br> The course was an opportunity grow their communications skills, build networks and learn about the work of our organisation at a national level. But it turned out to be so much more.&nbsp;Amuri member, Alex Thompson, described the course as ‘intense’, but worth every bit of the three days spent in the capital.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Lindy Nelson</strong>, founder of the Agri-Women’s Development Trust and 2013 Next business Woman of the Year, introduced the programme, helping to connect the women and uncover their strengths on day one.<br> &nbsp;<br> The participants spent half a day at Parliament, watching the machinations of the House in action, and meeting members of both the Labour and National party women’s caucuses.<br> &nbsp;<br> “It was fascinating, and we got to ask them some tough questions,” says Alex. “We were reminded to lobby our concerns through our MPs; everything the women’s caucuses had to say was very useful.”<br> <br> <strong>Vanisa Dhiru</strong>, chief executive of Volunteering New Zealand, shared her insights on how to inspire volunteers, and Ministry of Social Development staff talked to the participants about the It’s OK to Ask for Help and It’s OK to Help campaigns that we are partnering with in 2014, through our letterbox sticker project and distribution of information targetted specifically at rural people.<br> &nbsp;<br> At a working dinner, the women tackled the issues of mental wellness, farm accidents and moving into a new area.<br> &nbsp;<br> “The three things go hand in hand,” says Alex. &nbsp;“If someone is suffering stress, there is a higher likelihood of a farm accident happening, likewise moving into a new area can be very stressful, and can precipitate mental illness.”<br> &nbsp;<br> Presenting their ideas on these topics to<strong> Landcorp</strong> on the final day of the course, the women explored ways in which the two organisations could work together to try to get rural people to understand that It’s OK to Ask for Help.<br> &nbsp;<br> “We have brought back so many ideas from the course,” says Alex, “from encouraging local issues, to tips for volunteers in the community. &nbsp;We also want to make people aware of the huge amount of work Rural Women New Zealand does at a national level.”</p> 
<p>Building on the national programme, a Growing Southern Leaders course is being held in Mosgiel from Monday 16 June to Wednesday 18 June. <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/announcements/growing-southern-leaders-course-mosgiel">Registration form and Programme</a>.</p>

        <title>School bus safety trial 04-Apr-2014</title>
        <date>Friday, April 04, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/School-bus-Sign2_sized.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="border: 0px solid; margin-right: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left;" src="/images/School-bus-Sign2_sized.jpg">A year-long school bus safety trial in Ashburton has shown that illuminated 20K signs on buses can have a big impact on driver behaviour.</p> 
<br> 
<p>For years Rural Women NZ has called for clear signage on school buses to indicate the 20K speed limit in both directions when passing a bus that’s stopped to let children on or off.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Every day motorists speeding past school buses on rural roads put children’s lives at risk.</p> 
<br> 
<p>During the ‘Either Way It’s 20K’ trial in Ashburton there was a marked drop in speeds when the 20K signs were in operation, with many motorists slowing to between 25 and 35 km/h. </p> 
<br> 
<p>The bright LED signs lit up automatically when the bus door opened, and flashing amber lights operated for 20 seconds before the bus stopped and after it had pulled away, giving approaching drivers plenty of warning of a hazard ahead.</p> 
<br> The three-stage trial was carried out by TERNZ Ltd with funding from the Road Safety Trust.&nbsp; It began with an awareness campaign, followed by installation of the signs on Pearsons Coachlines’ school buses. The final stage was an enforcement operation by the police.
<br> 
<br> 
<p>While the awareness campaign increased knowledge of the 20K rule, alone it had little effect on driver behaviour. However installation of the signs on the buses had an immediate and marked impact.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural Women NZ hopes the 20K signs will be approved for use as part of next year’s amendment to the Traffic Devices Control rule, if not sooner.</p> 
<br> 
<p>TERNZ’s final report and recommendations will be submitted to the New Zealand Transport Agency by the end of June.</p> 
<br> 
<h5><strong>Background</strong></h5> 
<ul> 
 <li>In the 23 years since 1987, twenty-three children have been killed crossing the road to or from school buses. Another 47 have been seriously injured and 92 received minor injuries. </li> 
 <li>In New Zealand buses are multi-purpose and come in all shapes and sizes, the only requirement being to display a SCHOOL or KURA sign when they are used on a school bus run. </li> 
 <li>;Despite good education programmes in schools and through the police, children will sometimes behave unpredictably and have poor ability to judge the speed of oncoming traffic.</li> 
</ul> 
<h5><strong>Key Outcomes of the Trial </strong></h5> 
<ul> 
 <li>26% more respondents in the post survey knew the legal speed limit past a school bus when stopped to drop off or pick up children.</li> 
 <li>22% more respondents in the post survey claimed to normally pass a school bus at 20km/h when stopped to drop off or pick up children. </li> 
 <li>There was a 19% increase in the post-trial survey respondents that thought 20km/h was a safe speed past a school bus when stopped to drop off or pick up children. </li> 
 <li>More respondents agreed / strongly agreed that the sign combination (LED sign and school sign) was safer than the original school sign. </li> 
 <li>All stages of the trial showed a decrease in motorists speed past a school bus in 100km/h zones. </li> 
 <li>The enforcement + signs installation + awareness campaign showed the largest reduction in speed overall. </li> 
 <li>Long term results indicate the signs are effective at maintaining lower speeds past school buses with no accompanying targeted </li> 
 <li>The large external signs were legible from approximately 200m </li> 
 <li>The fields of sign performance exercise indicated that those motorists braking 200m prior to passing the school bus were able to reduce their speed to the 20km/h legal limit in a 100km/h area. </li> 
 <li>A set of signs on the front and back of a school bus is likely to cost in the region of $2000 installed.</li> 
</ul>

 <br> 
 <br> As well as safety concerns related to the illicit growing of marijuana in rural areas, rural communities are also being affected by teenagers’ anti-social behaviour when using ‘legal highs’.&nbsp; 
 <div>
  <br> TOUGHLOVE has issued a list of recommendations for parents of drug taking teens, saying parents don’t need to stand idly by whilst teenage children ruin their own lives and those of other family members through the use of legal highs. 
  <div>
   <br> It says:
   <br> • Declare your home a drug free zone
   <br> • If you think your teen is using legal highs or other drugs, search the house for them
   <br> • Include your teen’s bedroom in the search
   <br> • Confiscate any legal highs, other drugs or drug-related implements you find in your house
   <br> • Don’t let things fester. Speak to your teen at an early point about what you’ve discovered
   <br> • Don’t confront in anger. It could lead to a slanging match or worse
   <br> • Set consequences for further drug use and make sure your teen understands what’s involved
   <br> • Make sure your teen understands that you still love him/her and are serious about helping
   <br> • For further advice, contact TOUGHLOVE at www.toughlove.org.nz or by dialling 0800 868 445
   <br> • Join a TOUGHLOVE Parent Support Group and learn effective and proven strategies for coping.

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 1px;" src=" /images/Feijoas.jpg">In case you missed the interview this morning on <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2593894/food-fiona-gower-jellies-and-chutneys" target="_blank">Radio NZ Nine to Noon</a>, here are the recipes for <a href="#Mint Jelly">Mint Jelly</a>, <a href="#Feijoa Jelly">Feijoa Jelly</a>, and <a href="#Red Onion">Red Onion Chutney</a> our Region 7 National Councillor, Fiona Gower, shared.

<p><strong><em>Fiona Gower, National Councillor Top of the North Island (page 116)</em></strong></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients</span></p> 
<p>1.6 kg green apples</p> 
<p>1 cup (50g) chopped fresh mint</p> 
<p>1 cup (250 ml) lemon juice</p> 
<p>1 kg sugar, warmed</p> 
<p>½ cup (20g) chopped fresh mint, extra</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directions</span></p> 
<p>Cut apples into chunks. Place in a large pot with mint, lemon juice and 1.25 litres of water. Slowly bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 60 minutes or until the apple is soft. Stir to help break up any lumps. Cool.</p> 
<p>Suspend a jelly bag over a large bowl. Pour the fruit liquid into the bag and allow the mixture to drip through the bag overnight or until there is no more liquid dripping through the cloth. Discard pulp.</p> 
<p>Measure the liquid and place in a large pot. Add 1 cup of sugar for each cup of liquid and stir over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to the boil and boil for 10–15 minutes, stirring often. Remove any scum during cooking.</p> 
<p>Remove from heat and test for setting point by placing a little jelly into a plate which has been in the freezer. When this has been reached, gently stir through the extra mint. Stand for 5 minutes, or until the mint just stays suspended in the jelly.</p> 
<p>Pour into clean warm jars and seal. Turn upside down for 2 minutes then invert and cool.</p>

        <title>Aftersocks Restocked 14-May-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, May 14, 2014</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="margin-right: 2px; float: left;" src="/images/aftersock-monkey-FB-promor-2014_New.jpg">In 2010, Rural Women New Zealand launched <strong>aftersocks™</strong>, a fundraising initiative to support rebuilding Christchurch. New Zealand and the world showed tremendous support through this project, raising $130,000 for the Christchurch Mayoral Fund. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Mother Nature hasn't slowed down since then. NZ communities have faced further damaging earthquakes, drought, floods, damaging winds and even volcanoes erupting. </p> 
<br> 
<p>We think there's a need to continue to help NZ communities after an adverse event, so we brought back a limited stock of our original <strong>aftersocks</strong>. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural Women&nbsp;National President Wendy McGowan&nbsp;said, "We aimed to sell 1,000 pairs in 2010-2011, but through social networking <strong>aftersocks</strong> caught people’s imaginations and sales rocketed over 15,000 pairs. It's been an amazing project."</p> 
<br> 
<p>There's already been nearly 100 socks already ordered overnight. "We can't thank NZ enough for the support shown to communities through this proejct."</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Tumahu Branch with Plunket Nurses.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 177px; float: left; margin-right: 2px;">Over the last several months, Rural Women members around the country have pitched in to support Creative Fibre's singlet knitting challenge, in honour of then newborn Prince George. </p> 
<p>One group in North Taranaki donated its 30 baby singlets from the last four months to its local Plunket Nurse.</p> 
<p>The Tumahu Branch applied for funding offered through Rural Women from Campaign for Wool and were successful receiving funds to purchase 100% merino wool for the singlets. </p> 
<p>Joyce Downes, President of the branch, says, "I feel it was a great effort as we have a membership of 10, seven who are knitters!"</p> 
<p>The singlets will be distributed to local Plunket mothers as well as to the local doctor's surgery.</p> 
<p> "It's great to be able to give service to the community."</p> 
<p>In Tauranga, Oropi branch knitted over 100 pairs of socks and 12 baby singlets for the maternity unit at Tauranga Hospital. "We are more than happy to be knitting for a 'cause' and get a lot of pleasure from this," says branch secretary, Aileen Goodman.</p> 
<p>Altogether, Rural Women members around the country have knitted over 500 singlets and donated them to local maternity wards, Plunket and doctors' surgeries.</p>

        <title>National Volunteer Week 18-Jun-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, June 18, 2014</date>
        <img> /images/blog/NVW_2104-members-Story.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src=" /images/blog/NVW_2104-members-Story.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 2px;">When it comes to volunteering, Rural Women members know how to pitch in. Over the years, Rural Women have been the heart beat of the local community - bringing people together through volunteering to take the lead on spring fetes, BBQs, walks, and to raise funds for local causes. What we forget to recognise are the weekly cuppas that bring people together; the little things, the spontaneous gestures, which go a long way in your neighbourhood.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Volunteering can involve an action as simple as checking in on your elderly neighbour, or sharing the responsibility of delivering kids to and from the bus stop among the local parents. Actions such as these empower small communities. They bring people closer together, binding the community more tightly into a cohesive unit.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural communities rely on the support that their members can lend each other. Volunteering New Zealand Chief Executive, Vanisa Dhiru, says, “It’s about making a difference where it counts. In some circumstances, a big event such as a natural disaster calls for volunteer attention, but in the day-to-day running of a community, there are a lot of ways for people to help each other out.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>“Talk to the people in your area. Just by keeping in touch with those who live around you, opportunities to offer your time to make life easier for others will present themselves. The impact of something which seems so small to you might make a huge impact for someone else.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>National Volunteer Week is co-ordinated by Volunteering New Zealand, and will take place 15-21 June 2014. Take this opportunity to thank those who make a difference in your neighbourhood. Offer a helping hand to someone who may need it. This week is about recognising the effects of volunteering in our communities, and celebrating with the volunteers around us.</p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>The theme for National Volunteer Week this year is “Naku te rourou nau te rourou ka ora ai te tangata. With your contribution and my contribution the people will live.”</strong></p> 
<br>

<br> 
<p>“This is the sixth year we’ve run the awards, and we’re already fielding enquiries from women keen to enter,” says Rural Women NZ national president, Wendy McGowan. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Last year’s supreme winner, Diane Coleman of Treeline Native Nursery in Rotorua, says business is booming after the publicity that followed her win.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Though entering the awards may be outside some people’s comfort zone, Diane encourages rural businesswomen to pluck up the courage, as she did.</p> 
<br> 
<p>“Winning this award has been a once in a lifetime opportunity that was challenging, exciting, scary, fun, humbling and has really put my business on the map.”</p> 
<br> 
<p>There are four award categories in 2014: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Love of the Land - sponsored by Agrisea – for all land-based business, from animals to agriculture.</li> 
 <li>Help! I need somebody - sponsored by Access Homehealth – for businesses providing any type of service - from retailers to agricultural contractors.</li> 
 <li>Making it in Rural - sponsored by Telecom – for businesses that involve manufacturing or creativity.</li> 
 <li>Stay, Play Rural - sponsored by Xero - for businesses engaged in rural tourism or hospitality.</li> 
</ul> 
<br> 
<p>To enter the awards, women have to own and operate a small business with less than 10 full time equivalent staff, based in a rural area. The business must have been running for at least two years. If in partnership, women must be an active partner of 50 percent or more in the business.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Entries close Friday 5 September. For more on the Enterprising Rural Women Awards, <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=169233">get the information sheet</a>, and <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=169231">download your entry form here</a>.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The awards will be presented at the Rural Women NZ national conference in Rotorua on Saturday 15 November.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Each category winner will receive $1,000 in prize money and a trophy, with a further $1,000 going to the supreme winner.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 2px;" src=" /images/blog/Doubtless Bay_peria school_New.jpg">Doubtless Bay Branch has undertaken a fantastic project helping Peria School in 2014 to help achieve its vision of expanding its sustainable culture to generating its own electricity. This will hopefully free up funds to expand its curriculum to include more science equipment, formal music and art tuition, and heating its pool so it can be used by the whole community year round.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On Monday, 23rd June, Peria School in the far north became the very first North Island school to be solar powered. The switch on was officiated by Dr Russell Norman who was most impressed by the communities can-do attitude that facilitated this achievement without government assistance.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Featured in the photo above are Doubtless Bay Branch members Joan Petherick, Pat Shephard, Lois Garton and Gail Garton with Dr. Russell Norman. Featured below right is Dr. Russell Norman addressing the students, staff and guests at the 1872 Peria school with the new solar panels. </p>

<p>The discussion document - Modernising parental leave: Changes to allow greater access and increased flexibility has just been released and outlines the Government's proposals. </p>

<p>Rural Women New Zealand has been invited to comment on ways to modernise parental leave in New Zealand. We think the proposals will benefit rural New Zealand with its diverse work environments. You can have your say in our submission by <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RWNZparentalleavesub" target="_blank">participating in our brief survey</a>. <strong>Survey closes 5 pm 19 August 2014</strong>. For the full discussion document <a href="http://dol.govt.nz/consultation/parental-leave/modernising-parental-leave-consultation.pdf " target="_blank">click here</a>.</p> 
<br> 
<p>What are the key proposals in the discussion document? </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Extending paid parental leave entitlements to non-standard workers and those who have recently changed jobs. </li> 
 <li>Extending entitlements to ‘primary carers’, such as carers with parenting and/or guardianship orders, and grandparents. </li> 
 <li>Enabling employees to work limited hours or days during their paid parental leave period if they choose. </li> 
 <li>Enabling employees to take unpaid leave part time and flexibly, by mutual agreement with the employer. </li> 
 <li>Extending unpaid leave to workers who have been with their employer for more than six months, but less than 12 months, on a pro rata basis according to the length of their tenure. </li> 
</ul> 
<br> 
<p><strong>How does this relate to the Budget 2014 parental leave announcement? </strong></p> 
<p>As part of Budget 2014, the Minister of Labour introduced the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Amendment Bill (No 2), which was passed on 16 May 2014. The changes extend the duration of paid parental leave, from the current 14 weeks to 16 weeks as of 1 April 2015, and to 18 weeks as of 1 April 2016. </p> 
<br> 
<p>At the same time Cabinet also agreed in principle to a range of measures to improve the parental leave legislation and to consult on the detailed design of these proposals with employers, employees and other stakeholders. This discussion document forms that consultation. </p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>What is this consultation about? </strong></p> 
<p>This consultation is seeking feedback on the discussion document, ‘Modernising Parental Leave: Changes to allow greater access and increased flexibility’. </p> 
<br> 
<p>The discussion document outlines proposals to modernise parental leave, by broadening the eligibility to better reflect current work and family arrangements; and providing more flexibility to increase choice and support labour market attachment. </p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>What is the status quo? </strong></p> 
<p>The Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 (the PLEP Act) currently provides for government-funded employment-protected paid parental leave to employees with at least six months’ continuous service with the same employer. Employees with at least 12 months’ continuous service with their employer are also entitled to up to 52 weeks of employment-protected unpaid parental leave, less any paid parental leave taken.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Northland Adverse Event - Rural Women NZ Assistance and Fundraising Appeal 23-Jul-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, July 23, 2014</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/northland flooded paddock for website.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 296px; height: 168px; float: left; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"></p> 
<p>Northland has been dealt a severe blow from adverse weather over the last couple of weeks and we know some of you wish to help those who've suffered losses, even from afar.</p> 
<p>As we know from past events, it isn’t just now that assistance will be needed and appreciated.&nbsp; It is later once the clean-up is finished that the effect of the stress may show itself.&nbsp; It’s well documented that such adverse events lead to a spike in family violence, while some people may suffer the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder later.</p> 
<p>Northland is an area with a large number of lower socio-economic communities that are less well-resourced financially to cope when disaster strikes. </p> 
<p>We aim to assist people under stress in the region now, and to help reduce the impacts further down the track, by:</p> 
<p>•&nbsp;sharing information about support available, including the “It’s OK to Ask for Help” campaign<br> •&nbsp;promoting and supporting Mental Health 101 courses (or similar) being specifically organised for the region<br> •&nbsp;working with other agencies to find out where help is needed<br> •&nbsp;organising community get-togethers, morning teas, bbqs etc to de-stress and share information<br> •&nbsp;raising funds to distribute to those with specific needs</p> 
<p>Northland appeal:&nbsp; If you’d like to donate to our Rural Women NZ Northland Appeal, please deposit funds into Bank Account 06 0493 0317603 00 (Kaurilands RWNZ) or post cheques to Rural Women NZ, PO Box 12-021, Thorndon, Wellington (donations are tax deductible).&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Our Regional Management Team will work with local agencies and support groups in the area to identify where the funds are needed most.</p> 
<p>If any members are in need of help, or you know of somebody in need of support, please get in touch with our Top of the North regional councillor, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d6b6462636c236a627a687f4d7f787f6c617a6260686323627f6a236377">Fiona Gower </a></p>

<div>
 <br> 
 <div>
  Creative, quirky member Kerry France was the driving force behind the group, who between them produced an array of 'hoarded' goodies from which the three entries were dreamed up.
  <br> 
  <p>They won the Kiwiana section with a fabulous moa, titled 'Extinct', made from feathers, material and chicken wire. &nbsp;</p> In the Recycled section they entered 'Catch of the Day' using fish nets, plastic handles and material and a second entry 'How Does Your Garden Grow' - pictured here - which not only won the Recycled section, but was also awarded Overall Winner of the Show from an amazing display of 51 entries.
 </div> 
 <div>
  <br> Gloria McHutchon, Moa Flat president, says "We enjoyed getting together for two working bees and each member took home tasks to finish off, before we met again to put them all together. &nbsp;Altogether there were over a hundred hours of work involved, but add to that a lot of laughter and enjoyment."
 </div> 
 <div>
  <br> All the hard work paid off, when the group took away prize money totalling over $1000!

        <title>Fifty Shades of Green - Great Barrier Gardening Group 25-Jul-2014</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Shirley Gray Fifty Shades of Green_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 201px; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;">When it comes to gardening you can't beat learning from someone with green fingers!
<br> That's the philosophy behind Awana branch's new Fifty Shades of Green group that meets each month on Great Barrier island. 
<div>
 <br> "There's nothing risque about the group," laughs Shirley Gray, pictured here with some of her heritage vegetables, "even men can join". &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> By exchanging seeds and plants and hearing from guest speakers, the group will share their plant knowledge - what to grow, where they grow and how to grow them.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> "It's all about trees, vegetables, flowers, sustainability and health," says Shirley.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> So far, members have given talks on unusual vegetables grown on the island and herbs.
 <br> Twice a year the group also plans to visit a garden on the island.
</div> 
<div> 
 <p>The Fifty Shades of Green group meets on the first Tuesday of every month. &nbsp;Guests are welcome to attend three Fifty Shades of Green meetings, and will then be asked to join Rural Women New Zealand, including the men.</p>

        <title>Rongo - Enjoying Eighty as an Access Support Worker 25-Jul-2014</title>
        <date>Friday, July 25, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Rongo_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Rongo_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
<h3>Enjoying eighty&nbsp;</h3> 
<p>At 80 years old most people are winding down, enjoying a well earned rest and perhaps settling into a comfortable routine. Not so Northland support worker Rongo Curry who recently celebrated her 80th birthday.</p> 
<p> Rongo joined Access as a support worker at the sprightly age of 69 in 2003, where she remains an inspiration, actively working 3-4 days a week split between day and night shifts. 'Turning eighty, I couldn't have enjoyed it as much were it not for being able to continue working with Access,' she says. 'It keeps me active.'</p> 
<br> Recounting her birthday celebration - attended at her Marae by over 100 people including her large and supportive family of seven grown children, 15 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren - she says her family are glad she still works. They see the benefits it brings to her sense of personal achievement and well being.
<br> 
<br> 'I always say to people "don't grow old before you are old". Age can be as much about how you think as how you feel.'&nbsp; 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Rongo is a credit to people of her age. Articulate, smart, witty, this former teacher of Home Economics for over 40 years is a great believer in always growing.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 'Having completed my Level 2 and 3 (National Certificate in Health, Disability and Aged Support delivered by Access' in-house training provider Amida Training) I went on to do an advanced Level 4 specialising in Dementia. Now I'm keen to explore more spiritual studies so have a 'day off' a week to do a course with the Anglican Church concentrating on pastoral work. I've gone full circle in my walk of life and my spiritual studies help me feel grounded and give me personal growth. Being an active learner helps my brain so I don't tend to get tired. I tend not to discuss my studies with my clients though as I respect their individual spiritual beliefs.'
 <br> 
 <br> When asked about what she enjoys most about her work, she says 'I think a lot of my clients find I can relate to their stories. It's always easy conversation and we are very compatible. We often converse about radio programmes, gardening or current affairs and it inspires us all to&nbsp;keep more active, both mentally and physically. I can see my clients twice a day and they look forward to having someone listen to them.'
 <br> 
 <br> While talking with Rongo her other line rings in the background. It's her Whangarei Access office asking if she can help with another client tomorrow night. She gladly accepts. 'I have three regular clients in their 90s who I help with medication, security checks and preparing meals. I also help other teams with nine people ranging in age from late 70s to early 90s, three nights a week.'
 <br> 
 <br> Rongo parts with some surprising words, 'If you're not 80, look forward to it! I still have my driving licence, I go to the doctors and nurse regularly for check ups and this helps keep me able to do what I do. But at my age I'm free to do exactly what I want to do. And that's no bad thing.'

        <title>Opotiki nurse wins Rural Women NZ-Access Homehealth scholarship 15-Aug-2014</title>
        <date>Friday, August 15, 2014</date>

<p>Ellen is studying to become a rural health nurse practitioner, and will use the $3000 scholarship to help fund her post-graduate diploma studies at the University of Auckland. </p> 
<p>Ellen’s goal is to become a rural nurse practitioner in Opotiki, the community she grew up in and where she currently works in general practice.</p> 
<p>“I am immensely grateful for the support from Rural Women NZ and Access Homehealth,” says Ellen. “Born and bred a country girl I understand&nbsp;what it is to be rural and what it takes to deal with illnesses in a rural setting. Distance can be a big issue. My aim to improve access to quality health care for rural New Zealand.”</p> 
<p>Access Homehealth CEO, Graeme Titcombe, says, “Ellen was chosen for her academic excellence, professional dedication in providing medical care to rural communities, and for the potential benefit her study can bring to the rural sector she serves.”<a name="_GoBack"></a> </p> 
<p>The annual Rural Women NZ/Access Homehealth scholarship is given to health worker who wishes to further their health or disability studies at post-graduate level, with a focus on the rural sector. Ellen was chosen from a strong field of 20 applicants.</p> 
<p>Ellen has already completed a non-prescribing practicum and is an advanced nurse in rural practice, having completed a Masters of Nursing last year.</p> 
<p>Her new studies will enable her to prescribe medications, following changes to the New Zealand Nursing Council’s scope of practice for nurse practitioners last year.</p>]]></body>

        <title>2014 Election: Hard Questions 03-Sep-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 03, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Wgtn_website.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/Wgtn_website.jpg" alt="Parliament" style="width: 300px; float: left; height: 174px; margin-right: 3px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;">As the election draws near and the debates have taken place, Rural Women encourages all to think on what are the big concerns affecting your community? What are your local candidates' or political party's stance on the issues? Can candidates ensure your concerns will be addressed through positive legislative changes?</p> 
<br> 
<p>To find out the answers, we need to ask hard questions on big issues.</p> 
<br> 
<p>To start the ball rolling we have produced a Manifesto that tackles the big issues that are impacting on our communities. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Please contact your local Rural Women New Zealand National Councillor if you would like any advice/support on issues of concern to you. This is your opportunity to ensure candidates know the issues and have some answers.</p> 
<h3>Sample 'hard questions' </h3> 
<ol> 
 <li>Victims of family violence will stay in a relationship for up to 22 years (though the average is two years) because of a well-founded fear that their animals will be maimed or killed. Most states in America include protection of animals in protection orders. The Animal Welfare Act does not cover this unique and urgent circumstance. One of the conditions in NZ Domestic Protection Orders is that the person committing the violence "… must not damage or threaten to damage the applicant's property…"<br> <br> <strong>Question: If you are the Government will you amend the Domestic Violence Act that allows for the applicants property to include pets and stock to be immediately protected on the issuing of an order by the court? </strong></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Many rural areas face uncertainty about the continuance of power supply after 2015. Presently there are roads where lines are being downgraded causing random failures to the power supply. We are told that consumers ‘reasonable’ electricity needs will be met. We note affordability is missing.<br> <br> <strong>Question: If you are the Government how will you give greater certainty after 2015 than is presently being offered? How do you define "reasonable" in terms of policy? Can you guarantee that affordability is an integral part to your government’s policy? How will that be defined?</strong></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>According to Professor Jacqueline Rowarth in 2012, of 20,000 annual degree graduates just 80 were in agriculture. This is at odds when New Zealand’s wealth is significantly from our primary industries. <br> <br> <strong>Question: How will your Government address this anomaly?</strong></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Caring Counts 2012 produced by the Human Rights Commission offered 10 recommendations to improve the wellbeing of the aged care workforce. The current Government rejected all of them. They included basic recommendations such as fair pay, and pay for travel for home care workers. (<a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=174373" target="_blank">See what the 10 recommendations are here</a>)<br> <br> <strong>Question: Will you enact the 10 recommendations in Caring Counts?</strong></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Women over the age of 70 have an increased chance of breast cancer and yet the free mammogram service and access to the mobile service ceases at 69. This has a greater impact on rural women, while cost being an issue it is further exacerbated for rural women by the need to travel long distances to get their regular mammogram. Due to this it is documented that rural women are less likely than urban women to have regular breast health checks.<br> <br> <strong>Question: Will your Government consider a private/public mobile breast screening service where women over 70 years can use the mobile service and pay on visit? And would you consider making breast screening services free to women over the age of 70?</strong></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>The Freshwater Accord gives a level of water safety to a walk through level. Most submissions wanted safe swimming as the bottom line. For rural families lake or river may be the only place where they can swim and dive as they have done since families settled in rural areas.<br> <br> <strong>Question: Will you amend the Accord to have a percentage of rivers and lakes safe for swimming as the bottom line? What percentage do you think that should be?</strong></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>A Nurse Practitioners role is unique and takes several years of training. They would be a valued asset to our rural communities, if we could get enough of them. One of the barriers is that the Voluntary Bonding Scheme excludes Nurse Practitioners because they are not seen as new graduates. While a career in nursing is a prior requisite, the NP role is a whole other discipline. <br> <br> <strong>Question: As the Government, will you review the 2012 recommendation that Nurse Practitioners are rightly noted as new graduates and qualify for participation in the voluntary bonding scheme in hard to staff rural areas? </strong></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Hard to staff areas are defined by District Health Board catchments which have strong urban areas that are not difficult to staff. This has resulted in the scheme failing in rural areas where there is the greatest need. There are also DHBs with hard to staff rural areas that are not part of the voluntary bonding scheme. <br> <br> <strong>Question: Would you, as the Government, direct the DHBs to meet the needs of genuine hard to staff areas within their catchment? Would you n consider using a more targeted method of defining hard to staff areas across all DHBs? </strong></li>

        <title>Strong contenders for Enterprising Rural Women Awards 2014 11-Sep-2014</title>
        <date>Thursday, September 11, 2014</date>
        <img> /images/ERWA logo 2014.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src=" /images/ERWA logo 2014.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 212px; float: left; margin-right: 2px;">Seventeen exciting and innovative businesses are in the line up for the Rural Women New Zealand Enterprising Rural Women Awards 2014. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"This is the sixth year we’ve run the Enterprising Rural Women Awards," says Rural Women National President, Wendy McGowan. "It’s encouraging to see the diversity of businesses being run by women in rural areas and the significant contribution they make to the wider economy.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"Each year we see an increasing sophistication in the marketing and presentation of rural businesses that enter the awards.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"As broadband slowly rolls out into rural communities it is increasing business opportunities and levelling the playing field for rural enterprises, even when operating from remote locations. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"A web presence is so important for online sales and reservations. However, there are businesses who have entered who still have no cellphone coverage, which means added challenges in communicating with customers, and distance to markets is always going to be a factor."</p> 
<br> 
<p>Through the Enterprising Rural Women Awards, Rural Women NZ raises awareness of women’s entrepreneurship and their input into rural communities, creating local employment and often supplementing on-farm income.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The judges now face the challenging task of choosing finalists in the four entry categories: <strong>Love of the Land</strong> (sponsored by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agrisea.co.nz/">Agrisea</a>), <strong>Help I Need Somebody</strong> (sponsored by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.access.org.nz/">Access Homehealth</a>), <strong>Making it in Rural</strong> (sponsored by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spark.co.nz/">Spark</a>) and <strong>Stay, Play, Rural</strong> (sponsored by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xero.com/nz/">Xero</a>).</p> 
<br> 
<p>The four category winners will go on to compete for the title of Supreme winner, Enterprising Rural Women Awards 2014. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Entries in this year’s <strong>Love of the Land</strong> category include a plant nursery, a free range pig farm and an apiary.</p> 
<br> 
<p>In the <strong>Help I Need Somebody</strong> section there is a firm of accountants, a boutique law firm and an environmental consultancy.</p>

        <title>Rural Women welcomes travel cost settlement 12-Sep-2014</title>
        <date>Friday, September 12, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/PC010013.JPG</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; float: left; margin-right: 3px;" src="/images/blog/PC010013.JPG">Rural Women New Zealand welcomes <a href="http://beehive.govt.nz/release/cabinet-approves-between-travel-settlement " target="_blank">news that a proposed settlement</a> has been agreed that will lead to home support workers being paid mileage and wages for the time they spend traveling between clients.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"We have been fighting for this for 86 years, when a delegation of our rural women members first went to Parliament, calling for travel costs to be funded for this type of work," says Rural Women national president, Wendy McGowan. "We followed this up with an 18,000 signature petition to Parliament in 2005, but until today there’s been very little progress on the issue."</p> 
<br> 
<p>From mid-2015 support workers will be paid for their time traveling between clients and a further step early in 2016 will see support workers receiving a minimum level of travel cost reimbursement. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"The other welcome news is that there is to be a review of the whole structure of the homecare sector," says Mrs McGowan. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"Currently the industry is too casualised. It is very difficult to recruit and retain staff because of the uncertainty of hours and the very low pay levels.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"Given our aging population, it is vital that these issues are dealt with so that we can attract and retain the higher skilled people who want to work within the industry as a career."</p> 
<br> 
<p>The lack of reimbursement for travel expenses and time has particularly disadvantaged rural homecare workers, who often travel long distances between clients.</p> 
<br> 
<p><a href="http://beehive.govt.nz/release/cabinet-approves-between-travel-settlement " target="_blank">Today’s announcement</a> will see around 24,000 support workers more fairly rewarded for the very important work they do in supporting people to live independently in their homes.</p>

        <title>Te Kura O Hata Maria School wins HP competition 15-Sep-2014</title>
        <date>Monday, September 15, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/IMG_2109_web.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 231px; float: left; margin-right: 3px;" src="/images/blog/IMG_2109_web.jpg">Te Kura O Hata Maria School has been awarded $10,000 worth of HP products and support for their entry in the inaugural HP Rural Schools Competition.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Earlier this year HP New Zealand (Printing and Personal Systems Group) teamed up with Rural Women New Zealand to give rural primary schools the chance to win a share of $20,000 worth of HP products and support. To enter, rural schools were asked to submit an entry explaining why they needed a technology boost and how it would benefit the students. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Te Kura O Hata Maria’s entry was one of more than 60 creative submissions from schools across the country. A panel of judges, including a Rural Women NZ representative, had the tough job of narrowing down the entries to five winning schools, including Te Kura o Hata Maria, which received the largest share of the $20,000 prize. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Members of the judging panel visited Te Kura O Hata Maria in September to interview the principal, meet with students and understand the technology needs of the school. HP and principal, Maraea Herbert-Pickering, are now working together to select the technology the school will receive and educate the teaching staff on how to use it as an effective classroom tool.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"We're thrilled to be the winners of the HP Rural Schools Competition. We're a small school with limited resources so having new technology will make a huge difference to the digital literacy of our students," says Herbert-Pickering.</p> 
<br> 
<p>HP Category Manager Victoria Mahan says HP gained real insight into the need for technology in New Zealand's rural schools through the competition. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"It was humbling to see the effort schools made to enter the competition and to see the real need for technology in rural schools. Every school deserves access to technology to inspire students and support teachers," Victoria says. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"No matter what career path these students want to follow in years to come, students will need strong technology skills in an increasingly digitally driven world and we hope these HP products will get them off to a great start," adds Victoria.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Rural Women education spokesperson, Kerry Maw, says "We are delighted to be a part of this initiative. The HP technology boost is going to make a real difference to the winning schools."</p> 
<br> 
<p>Other winning schools included:</p> 
<br> 
<ul> 
 <li>Ruahine School</li> 
 <li>Kopuarahi School </li> 
 <li>Tuturumuri School</li> 
 <li>Pokeno School</li> 
</ul> 
<br> 
<p>Each school that entered the HP Rural Schools competition was also gifted an HP Action Camera. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Schools that missed out on major prizes this year will have the opportunity to enter the HP Rural Schools competition again next year. Details about next year’s competition will be released mid-2015. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Ko te manu e kai ana i te miro, nōna te ngahere. Engari, ko te manu e kai ana i te mātauranga, nōna te ao.</p> 
<p>The one who partakes of the flora and fauna, that will be their domain. The one who engages in education, opportunities are boundless.</p>

        <title>Adult Learners Week Events a Success 01-Oct-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, October 01, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Beaumont Tuapeka ALW (1).jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Beaumont Tuapeka ALW (1).jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; float: left; margin-right: 4px;">Rural Women groups around the country received funding from <a href="http://www.aceaotearoa.org.nz/" target="_blank">ACE Aotearoa</a> to organise events for Adult Learners' Week 8 to 14 September 2014.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<p>Forty participants from Winton, Heriot and Dunedin along with locals and four members from Henley branch took part in a day of learning, fun and lots of concentration for Adult Learners Week hosted by Beaumont-Tuapeka on 13 September (pictured left).</p> 
<br> 
<p>A full programme of classes saw people learning to make delicious feta and halloumi cheese; some learned to felt, producing cellphone covers and flowers; others took part in foot and shoulder massage, learn-to-crochet, scrapbooking and card-making sessions (pictured below right). </p> 
<br> 
<p>Margaret Healy says, "Participants brought their own lunch and our Beaumont-Tuapeka branch supplied morning and afternoon tea. We had a multi-draw raffle with a great assortment of prizes."</p> 
<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Beaumont Tuapeka ALW (2) copy.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; float: right; margin-left: 4px;"></p> 
<br> 
<p>At the end of the day the verdict was a ‘fantastic’ and ‘excellent’ day, with participants already brimming with ideas for what they’d like to learn next year for Adult Learners Week: bread, candle, jewellery, soap and sausage making, photography, square dancing, dry stone walling and repeating things they learned this time. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"So plenty of scope for another day, and many thanks to ACE Aotearoa for their help," says Margaret.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Following on from last year’s successful Adult Learners Week event, Rai Valley members repeated the winning format, putting on a meal for migrant workers in the area with a local doctor giving a talk on men’s health, followed by a Civil Defence update. The group also held an IT upskilling course, learning to use Facebook, YouTube and Skype. (pictured below)<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Rai Valley Adult Learners Week.jpg" style="float: right;"></p> 
<br> 
<p>Rukuhia members and friends held a two hour IT session with two tutors at Melville intermediate.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Janet Williams said, "National MP’s Tim Macindoe and David Bennett popped in at our request to see how Adult Learners Week funding was being spent. I gave them an apron each and information on Rural Women."</p> 
<br> 
<p>One of the participants said, "I have been struggling with my online early childhood studies. I am so grateful to the principal David Cook and his computer technician Richard. They both warmly welcomed me and Richard taught me some basics that I was unaware of, as well as a couple of things to do efficiently. It was very worthwhile my time to attend. Thanks so much. Nga mihi nui kia koe, a class well done!" (pictured below) <img alt="" src="/images/blog/Adult Learners Week Rukuhia.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; vertical-align: middle;"></p> 
<br> 
<p>In Southland six inter-provincial members gathered at Senior Net to hear Bruce Smart share some computer insights. Mary Earwaker says members learnt about Drop Box, where minutes and any other documents relevant to a group can be stored, and members can retrieve them, which saves emailing everyone. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"He showed us some of the amazing things that you can see and hear on the internet."</p> 
<br> 
<p>Members were encouraged to attend Senior Net classes, and Mary’s already enrolled for a one week course.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Gendie Somerville-Ryan president of Awana branch says they were thrilled with the turnout of around 50 people to their 'Man up to prostate cancer' Adult Learners' Week event, with nearly 65 percent of the audience being males. "Not bad out of a population of 885 - over 5% of the total!"</p> 
<br> 
<p>Ralf Golobovsky and David Snow spoke openly – and movingly – about their experience of being diagnosed and treated for the cancer. Dr Lilian van Alphen then explained the structure and function of the prostate, and talked about the problems with current tests and treatments. Monitoring is really important and Aotea Health is encouraging monitoring for those with a family history of prostate cancer from 40 years of age and those with no family history from 50 years of age. These ages are based on medical statistical evidence.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Gendie says the surprise of the night was the number of men who asked questions and shared experiences. This ranged from how men can do pelvic floor exercises to keep muscles around the urethra strong (yes, men can do this too!) to whether sex is a protection against prostate cancer (unfortunately there is no evidence this is so).</p> 
<br> 
<p>"Prostate cancer affects the whole family and our men are precious – Rural Women know men in isolated communities often need to be encouraged, and reminded, to be monitored. If you haven’t been tested yet, call in to your doctors, because the only thing you have to be afraid of is doing nothing."</p>

Check out the <a href="http://www.aceaotearoa.org.nz/" target="_blank">ACE Aotearoa website for event ideas</a>, or get in touch with us at National Office. There will be funding available next year for Adult Learners' Week and we'll be sure you're the first to know!</p>]]></body>

        <title>Toko School is Growing 08-Oct-2014</title>

<br> 
<p>"The school has been very busy," says Helen Jones, President of the Central Taranaki Dinner Group and member of the Toko Rural Women group. "They have used the funds to plant a heritage orchard, have learned about planting and looking after the trees as well as how to graft. It was really great to see so much done."</p> 
<br> 
<p>The school has also planted feijoa trees as shelter for their orchard, and will sell the fruit to help fund their future ventures, including investing in chickens to be able to sell the eggs.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The school has just finished building a greenhouse out of recycled plastic bottles that will serve two purposes. The first is to grow seedlings for the orchard and vegetable garden inside, while the second is for the children to design a watering system using the runoff from the greenhouse.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"We were invited along by Toko School's principal, Kim Waite, to have a look at everything done to date. All in all the ladies from Toko Rural Women were very impressed with how the school's used its funds from the Farmlands and us, and their Principal was most grateful for the opportunity the students have been given."</p> 
<br>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/Aoroa-Group-31-children.jpg" style="width: 310px; height: 200px; float: left; margin-right: 3px;">Rural Women New Zealand members have given generously to our Northland flood appeal, with $1,570 donated. </p> 
<br> 
<p>Thanking members for their contributions, Top of the North national councillor, Fiona Gower says, "So far this money has been used in various ways to support people affected by the flooding, including helping to fund a Northland Rural Support trust movie event in Dargaville, and for Kaikohe couples seriously affected by the floods to take a break, as well as providing some much appreciated boxes of baking, treats and gifts for children.</p> 
<br> 
<p>"Using Adverse Events funding from Ministry for Primary Industries, we are looking at the following events - a kids' movie day at Dargaville for children from the worst affected areas; providing a small group of playcentres with funding to run fun events near Whangarei, and funding for a get together for women at Kaikohe."</p> 
<br> 
<p>The children's movie day was hosted at the Dargaville Anzac Movie Theatre and was organised by Aoroa Rural Women to help relieve stress for families by giving parents a bit of a break while the children have fun for a few hours. There were 31 children who attended. (pictured above)</p> 
<br> 
<p>Some of the money donated will be used to provide ongoing support for those still struggling with the long-term effects of the storms.</p>]]></body>

The milk is processed in Biddy’s licensed cheese room to make traditional renneted hard farmhouse cheese, using the same techniques used centuries ago, but with modern standards of hygiene. It has a wholly natural rind sealed with clarified butter, made from the cream. It is matured over several months.</p> 
<p>Biddy milks the cows herself using a single cluster milking plant and the cows are strip milked by hand. Each cheese is made from the milk of a single named cow, so visitors can see and pat the actual cow it came from. <a href="http://www.cwmglyn.co.nz/cheese.html" target="_blank">Cwmglyn Farmhouse Cheese</a> won Silver at the World Cheese Awards in 2013 in the UK, one of the largest cheese competitions in the world, with 30 countries competing with 2777 entries. It was the only NZ winner.</p> 
<p>Biddy is a strong advocate for food regulations to be tailored in compliance costs to cottage industry sized operations, such as in the UK, when their own milk is used, rather than buying in.</p>

<p>Rachael has a passion for rural living, conservation, animal rights, promoting NZ business and products and creating a self-sustainable business from home, having turned her back on a career in graphic communications and computing in the urban corporate world.</p> 
<p>Seven months into a course on Medical Herbalism, she came up with the idea of creating an e-commerce retail store selling only NZ made healthy, organic, sustainable and eco-friendly products, called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecochi.co.nz" target="_blank">www.ecochi.co.nz</a>.</p> 
<p>She then started creating her own line of natural products, beginning with Bee Kind Beeswax Polishes sold through <a href="http://www.beekind.co.nz" target="_blank">www.beekind.co.nz</a>, using formulas for furniture and leather using old traditional recipes and ingredients such as Carnauba wax, plant oils, essential certified plant oils, eucalyptus and manuka oil. These waxes are now sold throughout NZ and exported to Japan, Australia, UK, America, Sweden and Taiwan. </p> 
<p>By mid 2013 Rachael had researched and developed a range of honey-based skin care products and balms with manuka oil and active UMF manuka honey. This chemical free range is sold through <a href="http://www.honeybeekind.co.nz " target="_blank">www.honeybeekind.co.nz</a> and is exported to Taiwan, USA and Sweden. </p> 
<p>She developed a soap called Kaimanawash Soap, to fundraise for the Kaimanawa horses, the SPCA, SAFE and the Kiwi Care team. This has progressed to the development of a commercial non-chemical horse and dog soap named Naturally White, which will be marketed through Bee Kind and Ecochi NZ.</p>

<p>Anne and Harry Frost began their blueberry venture, <a href="http://www.mamakublue.co.nz/" target="_blank">Mamaku Blue</a>, in the 1980s when they planted a hectare of land in 2000 blueberry plants, propagating from these and planting another hectare in 1985. By 1997 the couple were producing blueberry wine, winning their first medal at the NZ Fruit Winemakers International Competition in 1998; something they’ve repeated many times since. In 2000 they built a new winery building including a shop, cafe, conference room, reception centre and museum, opened by Prime Minister Helen Clark, the first time an NZ PM had been to Mamaku.</p> 
<p>The couple have since developed a range of blueberry products including jams, chutneys, jelly, sauces and others to complement the wine liqueur and juice. </p> 
<p>They have continued to expand the orchard and built a purpose built factory including a 35 ton freezer, a blast freezer, cool rooms and fruit grading equipment.</p> 
<p>With the economic downturn in 2009 they decided to attend Farmers Markets, each weekend going to Auckland, Mt Maunganui, Tauranga and Rotorua with fresh produce.</p> In 2010 they began a research project with Massey on the health properties of their blueberries and juice. 
<p><a href="http://www.mamakublue.co.nz/" target="_blank">Mamaku Blue</a> have changed their business from export to local sales, from mainly wine making to juice making, reacting to market trends.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/ERWA 2014/Nicola-Wright.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 169px; float: left; margin-right: 2px;"><strong>Nicola Wright</strong></p> 
<p>Nicola Wright is a viticulturist, winemaker, chef, marketing manager and sales representative of <a href="http://www.wrightswines.co.nz" target="_blank">Wrights Vineyard and Winery - The Natural Wine Company</a>. In 2004, she and husband Geoff began with 25,000 grape vine cuttings. They now have three vineyards on 18 hectares of land, a straw bale home, a commercial winery and a cafe/cellar door.</p> 
<p>Nicola works at every level of this end-to-end business, which is based on organic principles, creating the organic and bio-dynamic preparations. They then developed a winery in three shipping containers, processing 30-35 tonnes a vintage. </p> 
<p>In 2013 the couple purchased the former Whitecliffs Vineyard, where Nicola was able to use the commercial kitchen to develop the food to match the wine.</p> 
<p>Wrights Vineyard is the first winery in NZ to be approved by the vegetarian society, using natural clay as a fining agent rather than fish, milk or eggs.</p> 
<p>In 2011 they introduced a label - The Natural Wine Company, promoting natural or wild ferments, offering everyday, affordable organic wine.</p> 
<p>Nicola says she and Geoff are pioneering spirits, willing to give it a go and to create a market for products from the edge (Gisborne).</p> 
<p>They have also gone on to develop a tourism experience including live music and a cellar door experience with local steam train passengers. When the local cycle tours company shut down they created their own touring company and they also market to cruise ship visitors.</p> 
<br> 
<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/ERWA 2014/Georgia-Richards-and-Dot-Kettle.jpg" style="width: 220px; height: 147px; float: right; margin-left: 2px;"><strong>Georgia Richards and Dot Kettle</strong></p> 
<p>In 2008, Georgia and Dot moved from city jobs in Wellington to a 42ha property in Dove Valley in the Tasman region. The hot summers and frosty winters were perfect for growing Peonies. They purchased thousands of tubers and by 2011 were selling cut flowers for the domestic and export market. As complete novices, with no horticultural experience, they'd learned a lot from members of the NZ Peony Society, learning from 'old hands'. From this, the business began to unfold into&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doveriver.co.nz" target="_blank">Dove River Peonies</a>.</p> 
<p>They then became keen to diversify by adding natural healthcare products based on the anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial property of the peony root, approaching a local handmade soap manufacturer to produce a selection of peony-based handmade luxury soaps for sensitive skin. These are sold at the Nelson market and <a href="http://www.doveriver.co.nz" target="_blank">online</a>.</p> 
<p>They then began working with a Nelson complementary medicines manufacturer to develop a 100% natural, hypo-allergenic, peony based cremes range for the relief of eczema, psoriasis and to repair damaged skin. These will be launched in October.</p> 
<p>They are the only producer of NZ peony root in natural products, and this year they began planting NZ’s first BioGro organic peony root plantation.</p> 
<p>For the health products, they follow British Pharmacopeia harvesting protocols.</p> 
<br> 
<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/ERWA 2014/Ann-Maree-Robinson.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 338px; float: left; margin-right: 2px;"><strong>Ann-Maree Robinson</strong></p> 
<p>Spurred on by the big spring storm of 2010, the worst in a generation, <a href="http://www.robinsonraincoats.co.nz" target="_blank">Robinson Raincoats</a> was born out of desperation when Ann-Maree needed to track down plastic lamb covers and found they were like hens teeth. She found an old cellphone number on a box, and tracked down the original supplier, who had gone out of manufacturing. She asked to buy his machinery which he agreed to deliver in a couple of days time. Then followed half an hour of training and Ann-Maree was in business.</p> 
<p>By the next day they were being delivered to desperate sheep farmers. Now, son (high school student) Jeffrey does the manufacturing and Ann-Maree does the rest of the business including orders and supplies, marketing, distribution, packaging, invoicing, wages, record keeping etc. They do it as a means of guaranteeing supply for their own farm, and providing a service to fellow sheep farmers. It’s also a way of helping the NZ economy, as the plastic covers protect and promote the growth rates of new born lambs. If each roll of covers saves five lambs from perishing, that’s an extra $2.5 million injected into the NZ economy over the last four seasons.</p>]]></body>

<p>Putake Honey is a commercial apiary on the outskirts of Blenheim was started in 2011 with 150 hives. Renee co-founded the business and until mid 2014 did all the beekeeping and day to day operations, with husband Dale, who works full time in Wellington, taking over during weekends. With growth of the business, they now employ two full time staff, including a bee-keeper. They are shareholders in Betta Bees Research Ltd, supporting research through a common goal. They have also developed their own Bee App tool, using IT to optimise the management of the hives, plant and people. They are in the beta testing phase at present and hope to have a subscription based service for sale at the International Beekeeping conference in September 2015. They have also developed a joint venture with a scientific research based team in Wellington to develop hive products (honey, pollen, propolis and venom) leveraging the unique characteristics of NZ’s native flora and fauna. Putake honey is raw and not blended, which has won gold, silver and bronze medals at the NZ Honey Show in its second vintage. </p>]]></body>

        <title>Wild Jewels and Education in Kenya 24-Oct-2014</title>
        <date>Friday, October 24, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/WJ-LOGO_web.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/WJ-LOGO_web.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 2px;">Sisters Liza and Amy Cronhelm are the designers and owners of Wild Jewels, a stunning and unique jewellery collection featuring sterling silver, freshwater pearls, hand selected paua, Mother of Pearl and semi-precious stones. Their collection is sold internationally on 6-star cruise ships such as Regent, Seabourn, Silversea, and Oceania. You can purchase the items on their website, <a href="http://www.wildjewels.net" target="_blank">www.wildjewels.net</a>, and are in select stores within New Zealand and the USA.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The stunning beauty of the Paua and Mother of Pearl shell is enhanced by the pure elegant lines of their designs. Wild Jewels designs are unique and many of their necklaces, bracelets and earrings are reversible – the irridescent beautiful paua on one side and white Mother of Pearl on the other, making it truly versatile. You feel like you are getting two pieces in one!</p> 
<br> 
<p>Raised at Port Jackson at the top of the Coromandel they had an idyllic childhood. "We were on Correspondence and our playground was the farm or the sea. We were very fortunate as the neighbours had kids the same age as us, so we were always out on the horses, the boat or on the motor bike having fun or helping on the farm," says Amy.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Amy and Liza have quite the life. "We get to work at something we love, travel the world, meet extraordinary people and work in Northern Kenya on our educational projects," said Liza.</p> 
<br> 
<p>With a passion for giving back, the sisters formed <a href="http://www.michaelcronhelmfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Michael Cronhelm Foundation Trust </a>(MCFT) supporting children and education in Kenya.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Liza and Amy created this New Zealand registered foundation in honour of their late brother Michael, whom they lost to cancer in 2004. Michael had been working in Kenya for four years with an archaeological field school. </p> 
<br> 
<p>To date, Liza, Amy, the Trust and volunteers have built a library, started a preschool, and are now running a primary school. Liza and Amy are the driving forces behind the ongoing educational projects in Northern Kenya and are extremely proud of what has been achieved. Since the library was opened in Ileret all the children’s grades have gone up a level. In the words of one of the students "before the books and library came to Ileret I was a foolish boy and now I am a clever boy." </p>

        <title>Sale of Access Homehealth - a new chapter 19-Nov-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, November 19, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Graeme, Pamela Storey, John Ayling, Peter Mertens_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/Graeme, Pamela Storey, John Ayling, Peter Mertens_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 180px; height: 93px; float: left; margin-right: 11px; margin-bottom: 11px;"> 
<p>It was an historic moment when our National Council made an announcement to members on Monday 17 November that it has accepted an offer from Green Cross Health for the purchase of Rural Women New Zealand’s shares in Access Homehealth Limited. There are a number of Conditions Precedent to meet which we are confident will be satisfied. The change of ownership is expected to come into effect in December.</p> 
<br> 
<br> 
<p> This was a significant decision for our National Council given the origins of Access Homehealth, which evolved from the bush nurse and housekeeping schemes, set up in the mid-1920s by members of the Women's Division of the Farmers Union. The pioneering work of our members, and the tireless work of Access CEO Graeme Titcombe growing the business to what it is today is acknowledged. He is pictured above with outgoing chair, John Ayling, board member Pamela Storey and Green Cross chairman, Peter Merton.</p> 
<br> 
<br> 
<p>Access is now one of the largest providers of homecare services in the country, contracted to DHBs, the Ministry of Health and ACC. Today the business is a sophisticated one, requiring significant ongoing investment in technology, a commitment to training and a move towards an integrated service model of delivery.</p> 
<br> 
<br> 
<p> In considering the $18 million offer from Green Cross Health, National Council looked at whether Access remained a core service for Rural Women New Zealand. Could we make better use of the capital for the benefit of our members and the wider rural community? &nbsp;We believe so.</p> 
<br> 
<br> The offer from Green Cross Health was an attractive one, as the company saw the value in acquiring a national homecare provider that serviced both urban and rural. &nbsp;Green Cross Health is committed to continuing Access’ proud tradition of providing specialised home-based care and support. It has also undertaken to fund our present rural scholarships and awards.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Green Cross Health has invited Rural Women New Zealand to propose a member for consideration for appointment to the Green Cross board.&nbsp;
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<p> Green Cross Health will retain the name and brand of Access Homehealth and will provide continued employment to all its staff. Green Cross Health is listed on the NZ Stock Exchange and is a leading primary healthcare provider through its pharmacy, medical and community healthcare divisions. For its part, the purchase of Access Homehealth will enhance its ability to offer integrated healthcare solutions nationwide.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> 
<br> 
<p> While the sale of Access is a significant step, Rural Women New Zealand's National Council believes it is the right one and offers exciting opportunities and a strong financial future for our organisation.</p>

        <title>Enterprising Rural Women Award Winners 19-Nov-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, November 19, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/ERWA 2014/Supreme Winners Keri Johnston, Haidee McCabe with Wendy McGowan_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/ERWA 2014/Supreme Winners Keri Johnston, Haidee McCabe with Wendy McGowan_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 150px; height: 100px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">A South Canterbury-based environmental consultancy duo are the Supreme Winners of this year’s Enterprising Rural Women Awards, announced at the Rural Women national conference in Rotorua at the weekend. &nbsp; 
<div>
 <br> Keri Johnston and Haidee McCabe, principals of Irricon Resource Solutions, have seen strong business growth since they established their joint consultancy in 2010. They now employ nine staff located from Motonau in North Canterbury to Duntroon in North Otago, with expertise ranging from ecology to engineering, and planning to field technicians.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> A key feature of their business is Johnston and McCabe’s philosophy of fitting work around family and farming life, wherever that might be.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Keri Johnston, a natural resources engineer, says, “Where we are today was born out of a desire to have professional careers, but on our terms – working from home, around children and farming.” Keri and her husband farm just out of Geraldine in South Canterbury.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Haidee McCabe, an environmental consultant from Albury, explains. “Five of our consultants are women who would not be working professionally if they didn’t work for Irricon. &nbsp;Working from home means the best of all worlds for these women, and it allows them the opportunity to work, but be wives, mums and farm workers as well.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “Unless we’re in a hearing, we’re not a “suit and tie” type of business – our jeans and gumboots are well worn! &nbsp;Our clients really appreciate having someone turn up who knows farming. We can talk to them in their language about the issues.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “Because of the expertise we have, we can handle almost any job from start to finish – design, consenting, implementation and compliance. &nbsp;We have over 500 clients, and this number is still growing.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The business focuses on improving or maintaining the sustainability of natural resources, such as land, water and waste, and is also involved in irrigation and catchment management.&nbsp;
 <br> 
 <br> Irricon Resource Solutions also won the Help! I Need Somebody category, sponsored by Access Homehealth Ltd.
 <br> Other category winners in this year’s Enterprising Rural Women Awards are Renee De Luca of Putake Honey based out of Blenheim. Renee won the Love of the Land category, sponsored by Agrisea.
 <br> 
 <br> The Making it in Rural section sponsored by Spark was hotly contested, with the main award going to Nicola Wright of Wrights Winery and Vineyard in Gisborne, and a special merit award to Dot Kettle and Georgia Richards of Dove River Peonies from Wakefield, near Nelson.
 <br> 
 <br> The winner of the Stay, Play Rural Award, sponsored by Xero, was Bobbie Mulgrew of Easyhike, a car relocation service based at Glenorchy, servicing hikers of the &nbsp;Routeburn and Milford tracks.
 <br> 
 <br> In congratulating all the winners, Rural Women New Zealand national president, Wendy McGowan said, “Through the Enterprising Rural Women Awards, we are keen to raise awareness of women’s entrepreneurship and their input into rural communities. Women are not always good at promoting themselves, but we want to raise their profiles and give them credit for the huge amount of effort involved.”

        <title>A Wrap for IYFF 26-Nov-2014</title>

        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Fiona Gower(3).jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19.5px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left;" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Fiona Gower(3).jpg">A movie premiere was a stylish way to end the 2014 UN International Year of Family Farming celebrations, in which Rural Women New Zealand has played a central part.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our national president Wendy McGowan was at the Wellington launch on 25 November, along with national office staff. </p> 
<p>The movie "Family Farming in New Zealand - Our Stories" uses historic footage showing vignettes of family farming from the 1940s through to today. It was directed by Hugh Macdonald, and we hope to have copies on sale through our website shop as soon as they are available. </p> 
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/NxLccWa-pXQ">At the launch</a> Brendan Hoare, chair of the 2014 UN International Year of Family Farming NZ co-ordinating committee that commissioned the film, says his committee is thrilled to have been able to make this original and significant contribution to documenting the history and importance of family farming in New Zealand. He also acknowledged that Rural Women New Zealand was the most committed organisation to celebrate the International Year of Family Farming, "as one would expect."</p> 
<p>“Family farming is currently facing threats and challenges right around the world,” said Mr Hoare. “That's why the United Nations agreed it was worth dedicating a whole year to raising its profile, and encouraging governments and civil society organisations to support the valuable contribution family farming has made and can make to economic, social and environmental well-being.”</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand also ran its own photo and story competition, in conjunction with Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), which will be used to promote the New Zealand farming story in our overseas markets. View the wonderful <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sc/1atvv8f0lm5n3la/AAB_lJAV8_yPjxnSC2f0r6dQa">photos</a> that came in.</p> 
<p>We also held a series of roadshows around the country in the first half of the year. </p> 
<p>Acknowledging Rural Women New Zealand's lead role in the year, Brendan Hoare says:&nbsp; </p> 
<p>"Big thanks, deep gratitude and sincere appreciation for your contribution to the 2014 UN IYFF.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>We did well given the 100% voluntary contribution of our work. Our performance included: Investigative workshops, a launch at Parliament, multiple engagements over a range of means through conferencing, investigations, presentations, lobbying, media, publications, editorials and attendance at international conferences. </span></p> 
<p> The NZ team celebrated the completed the 2014 UN's International Year of Family Farming with the premier of our commissioned movie <em><span style="color: #351c75;">'Family Farming in New Zealand: Our Stories.'</span></em> This was a tremendous achievement given our budget and time-frame. Some of the footage Hugh Macdonald and his team were able to conjure together is a remarkable and valuable reflection of whom we once were, and how fast times are changing. Sector leaders at the premier commented on how little we know of our past and important it is to document the past and present. Ka pai Hugh." </p>]]></body>

        <title>Communities for Clean Water Campaign 28-Nov-2014</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Barbara Stuart for front page.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Landcare Trust's recent 'Communities for Clean Water' campaign successfully mobilised people all around the country in support of a 'weekend-of-action'.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>The campaign attracted &nbsp;plenty of attention, particularly from Rural Women New Zealand members, as highlighted by Barbara Stuart at our recent National Conference in Rotorua.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>Barbara is NZ Landcare Trust's Regional Coordinator for Nelson/Marlborough. After giving members a run down of the regional events that took place, she highlighted key aspects of the campaign which aimed to increase awareness of the practical opportunities people have to get involved in sustainability projects and also highlighted the real benefits this approach brings to improve waterways in New Zealand.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> Barbara took the opportunity to link the campaign to the Trust's project work, reinforcing our leadership role in community driven rural catchment management initiatives. Barbara has a great deal of experience working with farmers and landowners in the 'Top of the South', where a number of projects such as the Starborough/Flaxbourne, Sherry River and Aorere have gained national and international acclaim.
<br> 
<br> Speaking after the conference Barbara said "It was great to have a number of conference delegates approach me, congratulating me on the Trust's work. Many people were already aware of what we are doing in their specific region but did not appreciate our national presence. "

<p><span>The money was raised at Awana branch's two health awareness events in September and October – the <em>Man up to Prostate Cancer </em>educational seminar and the <em>Beauty and the Breast </em>art exhibition.</span></p> 
<p><span>The two events were so successful that Awana Rural Women will be running further events next year. </span></p> 
<p><span>“We are very lucky to have such a good medical centre on the Island and it is important that it is supported,” said Gendie Somerville-Ryan, President Awana Rural Women. “Rural communities, in particular, can miss out on the public education that happens in bigger centres. We were both delighted and surprised at the level of community interest and support of our health awareness events. Working with the Health Centre to provide expert information and hearing first-hand from those affected by prostate cancer and breast cancer ensured people got a big picture of the warning signs and treatment for both conditions.” </span></p> 
<p><span>The next Awana Rural Women health-related event will be a talk by Tony Hughes, Scientific Director of the AIDS Foundation, on April 7<sup>th</sup> 2015. He will speak on broad issues around HIV and Ebola, as well as other infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. Keep an eye on the Bulletin for more details.</span></p>

<p>The visit was organised by Janet Williams of Rukuhia branch, who suggested the visit to Shelly's farm, after Shelly entered this year's Enterprising Rural Women Awards.</p> 
<p>Janet says, "Over half of these young farmers were pig farmers, they knew how to pick up the piglets, and even cuddle them!"</p> 
<p>The Koreans study at the Korean National College of Agriculture and Fishery, the equivalent to our AgITO. Tour organiser, Tony Kim, says "Most of them are working in the farm and are highly skilled, so I think this journey will be beneficial for them to have another vision in the scale of farming, exporting high quality agriculture products and learning about farm management skills, which are very different from the farming system in Korea, which is indoor farming with intensive labour input."</p>

        <title>2014 Rural Primary Schools Garden Grants 10-Dec-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, December 10, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Bottle Greenhouse.JPG</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Bottle Greenhouse.JPG" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;">Gardening in schools is proving as popular as ever with over 50 entries received for the 2014 Rural Women NZ/Farmlands Garden Grants. Entries have now closed.</p> 
<br> 
<p>The eleven successful schools will be announced before the Christmas break, and they will each receive a cheque for $2000 from the proceeds of the popular Farmlands Ladies Nights.</p> 
<p>Winners will also receive a copy of A Good Harvest - Recipes from the Gardens of Rural Women New Zealand, and 20 litres of AgriSea Foliar and Soil Nutrition.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<p>"The money can be used by rural schools to buy equipment, seeds, trees or plants,” says Wendy McGowan, Rural Women NZ national president. </p> 
<br> 
<p>"Over the past three years we have seen more than 40 wonderful projects come to fruition, including composting systems, potting sheds and tunnel houses, orchards and vegetable gardens. One creative school even used recycled plastic bottles to build a greenhouse.”</p>

        <title>20K signs without delay call 15-Dec-2014</title>
        <date>Monday, December 15, 2014</date>
        <img>/Enforcement banner.jpg.png</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/Enforcement banner.jpg.png">Rural Women New Zealand says the recent accident in Canterbury, when a teen was hit crossing the road after getting off a school bus, may have been avoided if the bus had been fitted with flashing 20K signs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<br> Rural Women New Zealand took part in a trial of new LED signs in Ashburton last year, which included a public education and police enforcement campaign. The trial proved very successful in slowing drivers and Rural Women New Zealand hopes that the signs will be approved for general use on school buses in 2015.
<br> 
<br> "Rural Women NZ has been advocating for years for public awareness and driver education around school bus safety, especially the 20K speed limit in either direction. Using technology to get the message across to drivers has been a big part of our campaign."
<br> 
<br> The ‘Either Way It’s 20K’ Ashburton trial saw a marked drop in speeds when the flashing 20K signs were operating.
<br> 
<br> “The flashing lights and illuminated signs are visible for a considerable distance, alerting drivers to slow down
<br> especially in a 100kph zone.
<br> 
<br> "Every day motorists speed past school buses, putting children's lives at risk on rural roads and non-urban State highways," Mrs McGowan says. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br> The NZ Transport Agency agrees the results of the Ashburton trial are promising, provided they are widely and consistently used on entire school bus fleets, and supported by active and widespread community engagement and publicity. 
<br> 
<br> The Transport Agency is in discussions with the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Education and Police on the possibility of wider use of the signs from next year.
<br> 
<br> In the meantime, Rural Women New Zealand urges drivers to be more vigilant and slow down to 20kp/h when passing a school bus in either direction.
<br> 
<br> "Children of all ages can be unpredictable. It only takes a moment of inattention for a child to dart across a road without looking or misjudge the speed and distance of an approaching vehicle.”
<br> 
<br> Since 1987 23 children have been killed in New Zealand when crossing the road to or from school buses. At least 47 more have been seriously injured.

        <title>Great Barrier Island Scholarship</title>
        <date>Monday, December 15, 2014</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Cale Joy.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/blog/Cale Joy.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Congratulations to Cale Joy of Mulberry Grove School on Great Barrier Island who is this year’s recipient of Awana Rural Women’s $1000 Golden Jubilee Scholarship. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Cale was presented with the cheque in front of other Year 8 students at a special lunch at Barleyman Cottage. The three school principals, Ally Gibbs of Mulberry Grove School, Leo de Beurs of Kaitoke School, and Colin Griffiths of Okiwi School also attended, as it is the three Principals who select the recipient. Cale will be attending Mount Albert Grammar School and wants to do a mechanical or engineering qualification.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Cale has really earned the scholarship. As well as twice attending the Outdoor Pursuits Centre, participating in the SEA sailing programme and doing the Hunts Course with the local police, Cale has received many other school awards.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The members of Awana Rural Women know education is expensive and instigated the Golden Jubilee Scholarship in 2008 to help ease the burden on parents and families. "It gives members great pleasure to see our fine young people achieving in their studies, especially when they often have to cope with living away from home as well," says group president, Gendie Somerville-Ryan.</p>

        <title>Dame Margaret Millard appointed to Green Cross Health board 17-Dec-2014</title>
        <date>Wednesday, December 17, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Margaret Millard_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/Margaret Millard_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 8px;">We warmly welcome the appointment of Dame Margaret Millard DCNZM, JP to the board of Green Cross Health. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This will bring a rural perspective to the company’s operations, reflecting the original focus and unique strengths of Access Homehealth Limited, which Rural Women New Zealand sold to Green Cross Health on 1 December 2014.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“We are delighted that Dame Margaret has accepted this position on the Green Cross Health board,” says our national president Wendy McGowan.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Dame Margaret is a visionary leader and thinker who will ensure that the rural voice is heard during the many changes taking place, particularly in the homecare sector.” </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dame Margaret is a past president of Rural Women New Zealand, and served for nine years on the board of Access Homehealth Limited.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She brings not only a rural focus, but also a strong health and community background to the directorship with Green Cross Health. Amongst other governance roles, she has been a member of the NZ Red Cross Board and has also served on the Nursing Council of New Zealand.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dame Margaret Millard was awarded the Dame Companion New Zealand Order of Merit in 2002 for services to the rural community. She has a farming background through her involvement with family beef and dairying operations in the Manawatu, and represents the Rural Support Trust in Manawatu-Rangitikei.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Green Cross Health chairman, Peter Merton says, “We are honoured that Dame Margaret Millard has accepted our invitation to join the board of Green Cross Health.&nbsp; Dame Margaret’s experience and knowledge will be a tremendous asset to us as we focus on developing and delivering seamless primary health services to benefit everyone in New Zealand. Dame Margaret brings a wealth of experience in the care sector, nursing and awareness of the issues affecting rural communities.” </p>

        <title>Phone line and internet price rise proposal 19-Dec-2014</title>
        <date>Friday, December 19, 2014</date>
        <img>/images/blog/CHorus van.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="/images/blog/CHorus van.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 12px;"> 
<p>The Commerce Commission is consulting on proposals to increase wholesale prices for phone and internet services delivered along Chorus’ copper network.&nbsp;</p> 
<h4>Rural Women response </h4> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Rural Women is preparing <strong>a submission</strong> to communicate the effect an increase in wholesale prices would have on our rural communities. Your help completing our survey will assist us in undertaking an assessment of the full rural impact of the proposed changes. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/phone_internet_price_survey">Link to Survey</a>. <strong>Survey responses are required by Friday 30 January 2015.</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h4>more information </h4> 
<p>Wholesale prices are the amount that Chorus can charge retail telecommunication companies (like Spark, Vodafone, Orcon, Slingshot, and Flip) for use of their local copper lines and broadband service.&nbsp; While the Commission's proposed prices have yet to be finalised, a number of retailers have responded with plans to increase retail prices for phone and internet services. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> For example, Spark has said that on 1 February 2015:
<br> -the monthly price for a home phone only line in rural areas will increase from $51 to $53.50
<br> 
<p>-the monthly price for an entry level Broadband and home phone plan (40GB) will increase from $75 to $79. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h4>Why is the Commission suggesting that wholesale prices should increase?</h4> The Commission is required by the Telecommunications Act 1993 to regulate the price that Chorus can charge for access to its copper network. The Commission's current review of wholesale prices has been ongoing since 2011. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The latest set of wholesale prices proposed by the Commission are based on sections of the Act that require it to calculate what it would cost Chorus to build an equivalent network today. </p>

She was also the administrator for the Marlborough Provincial Federated Farmers from 2003 to 2011. Liz was introduced to rural life when she married Geoff in 1974, after having worked at the Marlborough Express as a reporter. Since then she has lived, farmed and raised a family at the head of the Waihopai Valley out of Blenheim. She was introduced to Rural Women New Zealand through her mother-in-law and credits our organisation for giving her many opportunities she otherwise wouldn't&nbsp; have had. She has graciously said that while being recognised in the New Year's Honours is a personal achievement, it is also significant as it acknowledges the work done by our organisation as a voice for rural communities and people. A highlight amongst her many achievements and leadership has been her role in setting up the Enterprising Rural Women Awards. Liz describes Rural Women NZ as a confidence building organisation for women. "It's a wonderful organisation that sometimes doesn't get the recognition it deserves." We are thankful that Liz Evans has had the recognition she deserves as a champion and voice for rural women with the awarding of this honour.&nbsp;]]></body>

        <body><![CDATA[<p>Would you be interested in taking part in a study into the effect of pesticides on the health of farmers? </p> 
<p>Massey University Research Nurse, Heather Duckett, wants to talk to farmers (sheep &amp; beef, dairy, deer), orchardists and horticulturalists/flower growers in the <strong>Lower North Island</strong> from Taranaki across the Central Plateau to Hawke’s Bay and south to Wellington as part of her research into the use of sprays (pesticides, fungicides and herbicides) and the effects on health. </p> 
<p>She wants to contact 50 farmers who either use sprays or who may enter paddocks after spraying has been done.</p> 
<p> The research is around the higher risk these people face as an occupational group of developing blood and lymph node cancers. </p>

        <title>Northland REVEAL Leadership Programme 10 March 2015</title>
        <date>Wednesday, January 14, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/REVEAL Photo for website.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/REVEAL Photo for website.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">Now's time to embrace your New Year’s resolutions! Register for the free REVEAL course being held at the Whangarei Showgrounds on 10 March 2015.</p> 
<p><br> </p> 
<div>
 REVEAL is a one day course that will inspire and challenge you to reach your potential, designed by 2013 NEXT Businesswoman of the Year and executive director of the Agri-Women’s Development Trust, Lindy Nelson. &nbsp;
 <br> Lindy Nelson is being brought to Northland by Rural Women New Zealand at the instigation of Dargaville member and CEO of the Kaipara Community Health Trust, Debbie Evans.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Debbie says, “In 2014 I attended the Rural Women New Zealand Growing Dynamic Leaders course in Wellington, which Lindy Nelson helped facilitate. I came away from Lindy’s presentation challenged and re-energised, thinking ‘I need to bring this fabulous woman to Northland to inspire others.’
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “We have so many volunteers putting in hours of effort to enhance our communities, schools, service and sports clubs, emergency services etc, but many rural people don’t get the opportunity for facilitated personal development.”
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The REVEAL course will help women recognise their unique skills and strengths, build confidence and help them reach their full potential.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> “You’ll learn new tips that help recharge your batteries and receive confirmation and acknowledgement of the skills you already have and regularly use,” says Debbie.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> The Whangarei REVEAL course is free to participants, thanks to funding from the Lottery Grants Board and Community Organisations Grants Scheme and is limited to 150 attendees.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Debbie urges, “Arrange a day’s annual leave, find a baby sitter, bring your mother, neighbour, sister along - everyone over the age of 16 is welcome. You don’t need to be a Rural Women® member to attend”.
</div> 
<div>
 <br> Women from the Far North to Franklin Districts are encouraged to register by 28 February by emailing Kath on 
 <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f59e9487929c9999b593948798869c9190db969adb9b8f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> or phone/texting Debbie on 027 558 6272.

        <title>Trees on Farms Videos</title>
        <date>Wednesday, January 28, 2015</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/images/Ann1_New.jpg" style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19.5px; width: 150px; height: 84px; float: left; margin-right: 11px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Southland member Ann Irving stars in a just-released <a href="http://www.nzffa.org.nz/branches/men-of-trees-members-area/men-of-trees-branch/branch-member-videos/ann-irving-waimatua-invercargill-southland-men-of-the-trees-branch/">video</a> promoting tree planting on farms as part of a nationwide Trees on Farms project, which was supported by Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
<p><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19.5px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">In all <a href="http://nzffa.org.nz/farm-forestry-model/resource-centre/trees-on-farms-videos/">68 on-farm videos</a> have been produced, thanks to funding from the Sustainable Farming Fund. Each features passionate farmers and tree planters who share what they've learned from years of experience.</span></p> 
<p>In her video, Ann talks about the tree planting that's happened over 42 years on her farm at Waimatua, Southland, and the importance of planting shelter for stock and to help the growth of other tree species. "You leave a legacy when you plant trees", says Ann, whose farm also includes an area of QEII covenanted bush.</p> 
<p>She also talks about the wonderful Rural Women New Zealand forestry project at Castledowns, Dipton, begun by members in 1949. All profits from this far-sighted project are ploughed back into the Southland community through annual charitable donations given by the local Rural Women New Zealand branches.</p> 
<div>
 Helpfully, the farm forestry videos can be viewed on the 
 <a href="http://nzffa.org.nz/farm-forestry-model/resource-centre/trees-on-farms-videos/">NZ Farm Forest Association website</a> by geographic region, or by soil or farm types – for example drystock, lifestyle, hill country, sand country, trees for soil conservation and trees for shade and shelter. The videos also cover the use of trees for timber and returns from harvesting.
</div> 
<h4>DVD BOXED SET</h4> 
<div>
 If your internet connection doesn’t allow you to view the videos online, you’ll be pleased to know the NZ Farm Forestry Association will soon have available a boxed set of the DVDs. These can either be borrowed from your nearest 
 <a href="http://www.nzffa.org.nz/branches">NZ Farm Forestry Association branch</a>, or purchased from the organisation.

        <title>Wishes come true for eleven rural schools</title>
        <date>Wednesday, January 28, 2015</date>
        <img>/Lauriston_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/Lauriston_New.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">Dreams have come true for eleven rural schools who are the lucky recipients of $2000 gardening grants announced by Rural Women New Zealand and Farmlands.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The scheme aims to equip schools to develop productive vegetable gardens and orchards.</p> 
<p>“This is the fourth year we’ve given out the gardening grants with funds from the Farmlands Ladies Nights,” says Rural Women New Zealand national president, Wendy McGowan.<br> <br> “It’s a great way to help schools teach children how easy it is to grow food and what makes a healthy diet. In past years the gardening grants have been used by schools to build tunnel houses, composting systems, buy seeds, plants, fruit trees and gardening equipment.”<br> <br> This year 52 North Island schools and 38 South Island schools applied for the grants.<br> <br> “The entries were colourful and enthusiastic, and in some cases included videos created by the children showing what they hoped to achieve in their gardens.”<br> <br> The lucky winners are:<br> <br> Otamarakau School, Bay of Plenty<br> Paparoa Primary School, Northland<br> Te Horo School, Kapiti<br> Wharepapa South School, Waikato<br> Norfolk School, Taranaki<br> Patoka School, Hawke’s Bay<br> Lauriston School, Mid Canterbury<br> Seddon School, Marlborough<br> Clutha Valley Primary School, Otago<br> Lake Brunner School, West Coast<br> Waianiwa School, Southland<br> <br> The cheques will be presented to the schools at the beginning of the new term.<br> <br> The schools will also receive fertiliser from Agrisea NZ Ltd and a copy of ‘A Good Harvest – recipes from the gardens of Rural Women New Zealand’ so the children can put all their produce to good use. <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br> Farmlands’ chief executive, Brent Esler, says the company is proud to continue its support of Rural Women New Zealand and the rural school garden grants.</p> 
<p> “As a rural co-operative it just makes sense for us to support schools that make up the hubs of the rural communities we service.”<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>

        <title>Afghanistan - Country of Study 2015 - 2 Feb 2015</title>
        <date>Monday, February 02, 2015</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/skateistan-girls-tamana-skate-garden-kabul1-sm.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/skateistan-girls-tamana-skate-garden-kabul1-sm.jpg" style="margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; border-style: solid; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 19.5px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;"> Afghan girls can't ride a bike, but can ride a skateboard.</p> 
<p>'Skateistan'&nbsp;began as a grassroots 'Sport for Development' project on the streets of Kabul in 2007, and is now winning awards as an international NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) with projects in Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa. Skateistan is the first international development initiative to combine skateboarding with education.<br> It all began when&nbsp;Australian skateboarder Oliver Percovich dropped his board in Kabul in 2007. He was surrounded by the eager faces of children of all ages who wanted to be shown how to skate.&nbsp;<br> <br> A group of Afghan friends (aged 18-22) shared Ollie's three boards and quickly progressed in their new favourite sport—and so skateboarding hit Afghanistan. The success with the first students prompted Ollie to think bigger: by bringing more boards back to Kabul and establishing an indoor skateboarding venue, the program would be able to teach many more youth, and also be able to provide older girls with a private facility to continue skateboarding.<br> <br> Skateistan has emerged as Afghanistan’s first skateboarding school, and is dedicated to teaching both male and female students. The non-profit skateboarding charity has constructed the two largest indoor sport facilities in Afghanistan, and hosts the largest female sporting organization (composed of female skateboarders). Skateistan believes that when youth come together to skateboard and play, they forge bonds that transcend social barriers.&nbsp;<br> <br> </p> 
<h4>BEYOND SKATEBOARDING</h4> 
<p>Skateboarding is simply "the hook" for engaging with hard-to-reach young people (ages 5-18). Skateistan's development aid programs work with growing numbers of marginalized youth through skateboarding, and provide them with new opportunities in cross-cultural interaction, education, and personal empowerment programs.&nbsp;<br> <br> In Kabul, Skateistan's participants come from all of Afghanistan’s diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and include 40 percent female students, hundreds of street-working children, and youth with disabilities. In the skatepark and classrooms they develop skills in skateboarding, leadership, civic responsibility, multimedia, and creative arts, exploring topics such as environmental health, culture/traditions, natural resources, and peace. The students themselves decide what they want to learn and Skateistan gives them with a safe space and opportunities to develop the skills that they consider important.</p> 
<p><strong>Afghanistan&nbsp;</strong> is Rural Women New Zealand's 'country of study' for 2015.</p>

        <title>Women Walk the World '90 for 90' Challenge - 29 April 2015</title>
        <date>Monday, February 16, 2015</date>
        <img>http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/WWTW Web Banner 2015 logos_New.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/WWTW Web Banner 2015 logos_New.jpg" style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px; float: left;"> Our 90th year is the perfect opportunity to put our best food forward!</p> 
<br> 
<p> To mark this fantastic milestone as an organisation, we’re issuing the&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">90 km challenge</span></strong></em> as part of our&nbsp;<strong>Women Walk the World 2015</strong> event.</p> 
<br> 
<p> The idea is that groups of members, along with family and friends, collectively walk 90 kilometres to celebrate our 90th anniversary.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Women Walk the World is an annual event, where women’s groups in many countries organise walks in their communities along local tracks and trails, to raise funds for the Associated Country Women of the World.</p> 
<br> 
<p> It’s a great way to come together, catch up with friends and have some fun and healthy exercise along the way.&nbsp;</p> 
<br> The date for the event is 
<strong>Wednesday 29 April</strong> – ACWW Day - &nbsp;though walks can take place at other dates around that time if more convenient. 
<div> 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 We thank the 
 <a href="http://www.walkingaccess.govt.nz/kia-ora-welcome/">Walking Access Commission</a>,&nbsp;sponsor partner for this event. 
 <br> 
 <h3>Here’s what you do:</h3> 1.
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Decide on a walk for your group. It can range from a stroll around the park, a hike through the bush, an amble around a neighbourhood or along a walkway.&nbsp; 
 <br> 2.
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Invite others. This is a great way to reach out to new potential members, and include families and friends. 
 <br> 3.
 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Go to the 
 <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=188043">online registration form</a>, fill it in and return to national office before your walk, so we know what walks are taking place and can promote them. 
 <div>
  4.
  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>We have 
  <strong>50 T shirts </strong>and 
  <strong>pedometers </strong>for groups that register. Initially one set per group on a first-come, first-served basis. These will be sent on receipt of your registration form.
 </div> 
 <div>
  5.
  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>The idea is to raise funds. This could be done through sponsorship, a gold coin donation, or perhaps an afternoon tea or sausage sizzle afterwards. Here is a 
  <a href="http://www.acww.org.uk/forms/acww_walk_sponsorshipform.pdf">sponsorship form</a> you can use.
 </div> 
 <div>
  6.
  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Tally up the
  <strong> number of people</strong> who attend and the 
  <strong>distance walked.</strong>&nbsp; 
  <br> 7.
  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>
  <strong>Take photos</strong> and send to national office so we can publicise your walks and use on our website and Facebook pages. Email 
  <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="680d06191d011a010d1b281a1d1a09041f07050d0646071a0f46061246">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&nbsp; 
  <br> 8.
  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>Send your funds raised, and details of kilometres walked to national office.

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/images/Farmlands Garden Grant for website.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-right: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px;">Rural Women members have been helping to present $2000 jumbo-sized cheques to eleven rural schools who were lucky enough to win the Farmlands Garden Grants competition.</p>

        <title>Rail Trail Fundraiser for Guide Dog with Julie Woods</title>
        <date>Wednesday, February 25, 2015</date>
        <img>/That Blind Woman photo.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/That Blind Woman photo.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left;">Ever since she went blind in 1997, the Blind Foundation has supported Julie Woods.</p> 
<p><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">So, when Rural Women New Zealand asked her to ride the Otago Central Rail Trail with our members to <strong>raise funds to train a guide dog</strong>, she says there was only one response she could give: "Why not! "</span></p> 
<p>Julie says in 1997 when blindness first struck she was a young mother, married with two children aged three and one.</p> 
<p>"Not once did the Blind Foundation say no to me. They upskilled me to get back into the kitchen, they taught me how to touch type and read braille. They put a white cane in my hand and showed me how to use it! Nowadays, they help me, and 11,500 other blind New Zealanders be the best blind people we can be!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the fifth time Rural Women members have cycled and walked the Otago Central Rail Trail in a '<strong>Triple F Challenge</strong>' - fitness, fun and friendship. Each time they support a charity of choice. This year around 90 members and friends will be hitting the trail from Clyde to Middlemarch between 17 and 19 April.</p> 
<p>As well as cycling the trail on a tandem with her husband, Julie will be an after-dinner speaker.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The funds raised will be used to train a puppy and match it to a suitable blind person. The goal is to raise $30,000. &nbsp;You can contribute, even if you're not taking part in the ride.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Go to Julie Woods' <a href="https://give.everydayhero.com/nz/that-blind-woman-rides-for-the-blind  ">Everyday Hero</a> webpage for more information and the opportunity to make a donation.</p>

        <title>Beverley Forrester - The Farm at Black Hills - 27 Feb 2015</title>
        <date>Friday, February 27, 2015</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img style="border: 0px solid currentColor; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; float: left;" alt="" src="/The farm at Black Hills cover.jpg" unselectable="on">You won’t find a more devoted member of Rural Women New Zealand than Beverley Forrester. But then she’s the sort of person who does everything with cheerful enthusiasm and a huge dollop of ‘can do’ attitude.</p> 
<p> <br> Now Random House have published her memoir, which is set against the backdrop of the pioneers who established the farms and sheep stations in north Canterbury, and the long-established family she married into, bringing her to Black Hills. <br> <br> Beverley is available to speak to groups about her life and <em>The Farm at Black Hills</em>, and we hope you’ll support her, especially as she intends to donate royalties from book sales to Rural Women New Zealand to set up a scholarship. <br> <br> Beverley can be contacted at:&nbsp; <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0660697474637572637459646a67656d6e6f6a6a75467e72746728656928687c"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="75131a070710060110072a171914161e1d1c191906350d0107145b161a5b1b0f">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> <br> <br> Copies of <em>The Farm at Black Hills </em>will be available in bookshops and in our website shop from 2 April 2015.</p> 
<p>Alternatively you can attend the official book launch at Hurunui Hotel from 11am-1pm where Beverley&nbsp;will be signing copies.&nbsp; For full details click <a title="here" href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/events/the-farm-at-black-hills-book-launch">here</a>. <br>&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<h3>More about Beverley Forrester and the Rural Women connection.</h3> Beverley’s entrepreneurial spirit was recognized when she was a finalist in Rural Women’s inauguaral Enterprising Rural Women Awards, held at The Beehive in Wellington in 2009. 
<br> 
<br> With a love of all things to do with wool, her enterprises revolve around her prize-winning flock of coloured sheep. She is a sheep judge, has an interest in a woolen mill, has her own brand of hand spun yarns sold in outlets in the UK, US, Europe, China and Japan, and a range of hand knit fashion garments that have been shown at NZ Fashion Week. 
<br> 
<br> Many of you will know Beverley, a salt of the earth, capable woman with a big country heart who’s taken on all that life’s served her. 
<br> 
<br> Rural Women suggested to Random House she’d make a great subject for a book, so now we’re delighted&nbsp; to see her story in print (publication date 2 April). 
<br> 
<br> 
<em>The Farm at Black Hills </em>is about Beverley, and also the pioneering families who settled in North Canterbury. It covers the history of merino wool, and also the Romney and Corriedale breeds that have always been successfully farmed in the region. It’s about making farming sustainable, finding new income streams and giving back to the community which Beverley loves. 
<br> 
<br> Beverley met Jim Forrester, whose family had farmed in the area for four generations. It was a late start for both of them making a life together. 
<br> 
<br> Beverley, an occupational therapist, brought with her a beloved wee flock of black sheep, which she had run on an acreage outside of Christchurch for their spinning and weaving wool. 
<br> 
<br> Though Jim was initially skeptical about having black sheep on the farm, after farmers had spent generations breeding out the black lines. Imagine his chagrin when Beverley started winning prizes at A&amp;P shows! 
<br> 
<br> With Jim’s sudden and premature death, Beverley was left to run the farm that she had barely worked on as she was always off the property with her occupational therapy work. Over time she came to the heart-breaking but pragmatic realization that she would have to carve blocks off it, as it was too big for her. 
<br> 
<br> She knew she would have to focus and become more serious about marketing her wool and leveraging New Zealand’s clean and green image abroad. 
<br> 
<br> With the help of cousins in England, she’s set up a shop in&nbsp; Henley-on-Thames, where her wool is sold to a keen British market. 
<br> 
<br> She also saw an opportunity in independent tourism. She and her loyal Black Hills team set about painstakingly restoring the farm’s unique and historic limestone buildings which tour buses now visit, and where visitors get to see the sheep shorn in the original stone woolshed. 
<br> 
<br> The money made from the tour groups goes straight into rehab equipment that locals can borrow for free from her shed if they need walking frames, crutches, and so on after any sort of surgery, as there is no easy way for Hurunui district people to get this gear unless people travel into Christchurch. 
<br> 
<br> Beverley’s on the board of the Canterbury A&amp;P show and is in demand as a sheep judge — and she’s a mentor to many. 
<br> 
<br> So get yourself a copy of her new book and enjoy a great read about one of our very inspiring members. In bookshops and our online shop from 2 April 2015.]]></body>

        <title>The Farm at Black Hills Book Launch</title>
        <date>Tuesday, April 14, 2015</date>
        <img>/Bev.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=162</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/Bev.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=162" align="left" width="162"> On 2nd April, Beverley Forrester launched her book The Farm at Black Hills at a morning gathering at the Hurunui Hotel in Hurunui Village, North Canterbury. The event was hosted by the Amuri Rural Woman's Dinner group, who provided a lovely lunch with help from Helen Heddell - a long time friend of Beverley's, fellow colored sheep enthusiast and RWNZ member. We knew there would be great interest in the launch, and we were not disappointed. Over 50 people came through the door to sign the surprise guest book and talk to Beverley while she signed their book for them. <br> </p> 
<p>&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<p>There was plenty of time for stories, talk of times past, and it was clear to see the love and respect that the local people have for Beverley, and what she has achieved. After the signing, Beverley gave a short speech thanking long-time farm workers, presenting them with signed books, and showed three items of knitware that featured at New Zealand fashion week, all knitted by local ladies. At the end of her speech, Beverley talked about her co-writer John McCrystal, and to her surprise he had come down from the North Island for the launch and was standing at the back of the room. The morning ended with Beverley cutting a celebration cake featuring the view from her kitchen at Black Hills, which is also the cover of her book. All royalties from the sales of the book are to go to Rural Women New Zealand. You can order your copy from our online shop <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/shop/the-farm-at-black-hills" title="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/shop/the-farm-at-black-hills">here</a>.</p>

        <title>Rural Women and Olive Oil - What a Great Mix!</title>
        <date>Thursday, April 16, 2015</date>
        <img>/olive press opening 9.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=250</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/olive press opening 9.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=250" align="left" width="250">Where to house the new community olive press was the big topic of conversation when Gendie Somerville-Ryan, President of Awana Rural Women on Great Barrier Island, met Carol and Trevor Rendle of Barrier Olive Growers Ltd for coffee. Awana Rural Women, a branch of Rural Women NZ, owns its own premises – a hall and a garage. The garage was undergoing a major upgrade and would make the perfect place for the olive press. All it took was a cup of coffee and a chat and the olive press had a new home. </p> 
<p>“Awana Rural Women activities encourage community cooperation and development and what better way to demonstrate this than to help promote economic growth through horticulture,” said Mrs Somerville-Ryan. “Our facilities are centrally located, of a high standard and well-known around Great Barrier Island. Housing the olive press is very much in line with our philosophy of helping the community to help itself through education, personal development and building community capacity. It’s a win-win for everyone.” </p> 
<p>The community olive press was officially opened by Hon Nikki Kaye, MP for Great Barrier (and Auckland Central) on Friday the 10th of April 2015. Hon Ms Kaye acknowledged the perseverance and hard work of everyone involved in getting this project not only off the ground but up and running. “The reason this cooperative approach has worked on the Barrier is that so many people contribute. The olive press is important for economic reasons – it gives people another option to stay on the Island,” said Hon Nikki Kaye. “Awana Rural Women have been the backbone of the community and it is fitting they have been part of this project.” </p> 
<p>A recent survey showed that there were over 600 olive trees already fruiting on Great Barrier Island but developing an industry from the olives is impractical when the fruit has to be shipped off Island for pressing. Barrier Olive Growers has purchased the press and growers will be able to press their fruit for a nominal charge – hopefully kick-starting an olive oil “export” industry for the Barrier. </p> 
<p>Awana Rural Women can see a great future for Barrier olive oil, from an olive oil festival to an olive picking and pressing experience. However, the first step is to get the 2015 vintage harvested and pressed – and enjoyed by those on the Barrier and beyond. <br> </p>

        <title>Northland Rural Women REVEAL! Their Full Potential</title>
        <date>Friday, April 17, 2015</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Reveal Lindy and Debbie evans.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=288" align="left" width="288">When Debbie Evans attended the 2014 Rural Women New Zealand <a href="" title="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/BlogRetrieve.aspx?PostID=377580&amp;A=SearchResult&amp;SearchID=46363799&amp;ObjectID=377580&amp;ObjectType=55">Growing Dynamic Leaders</a> course in Wellington, she came away with a decision to inspire rural women of Northland.</p> 
<p>Debbie passionately wanted to share what she had learned at GDL and help Northland women recognise their unique skills and strengths, build confidence and help them reach their full potential. She decided she would invite <a href="" title="http://awdt.org.nz/">Agri-Women's Development Trust</a> executive Lindy Nelson to design a one day programme called REVEAL! </p> 
<p>Debbie wanted it to be free and therefore available for all women. Enter major sponsors Lotteries and COGS, plus in-kind support from <a href="" title="http://www.cowleyshire.co.nz/">Cowleys Hire Centre</a>, <a href="" title="https://www.farmlands.co.nz/">Farmlands</a>, <a href="" title="http://www.whangareiap.org.nz/">Whangarei Agricultural and Pastoral Society</a>, and <a href="" title="https://www.bnz.co.nz/">BNZ Bank</a> which together gave a total of $12,000 to run the day.</p> 
<p><img src="/images/Reveal celebration.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=200" width="200"> <img src="/images/Reveal and Farmlands.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=200" align="right" width="200"> <br> </p> 
<p>A small team of Rural Women members did the event proud with their typical ‘can do, will do’ planning skills and attitude, accompanied by large doses of encouragement from Kath Gillespie of RWNZ Aoroa Branch and Top of the North RWNZ National Councillor Fiona Gower </p> 
<p>Several weeks before the course date it was already over-subscribed and the waiting list was growing. </p> 
<p>A partnership between Rural Women New Zealand and Agri-Women’s Development Trust created a day of inspiration and life-changing challenges for 150 Northland women. “They had the benefit of a training day equivalent to any reputable training provider complete with an amazing morning tea, fresh flowers and of course embroidered tablecloths!” says Debbie.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img src="/images/Reveal audience shot.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=450" width="450"> <br> </p> 
<p>“Receiving such affirming feedback such as how inspiring and empowering the day was from so many participants has been the icing on the cake,” says Debbie. “Being so oversubscribed shows that there is a need for more of this type of training for our rural women”. <br> </p> 
<p>REVEAL! was designed by Lindy Nelson, RWNZ member, 2013 NEXT Businesswoman of the Year and Executive Director of the <a href="" title="http://awdt.org.nz/">Agri-Women’s Development Trust</a>.&nbsp;</p>

        <title>The 2015 Triple F Challenge</title>
        <date>Monday, April 20, 2015</date>
        <img>/events/TripleF1.JPG?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=225</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/events/TripleF1.JPG?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=225" align="left" width="225">For the past three days, 17-19 April, RWNZ members and friends participated in the Triple F Challenge. They pedaled nearly 150 Kilometres of the Otago Central Rail while others walked up to 14 kilometres each day to selected scenic areas. </p> 
<p>The Triple F Challenge stands for Fitness Fund and Friendship and all three came in spades during this bi-enniel event.</p> 
<p>“The fact that there were 90 participants this year made it also a 90 for 90 event! Special guest, Julie Woods who is a Blind Foundation Ambassador and her husband Ron rode the Trail with us on a tandem bike sponsored by Trail Journeys.” Says Margaret Pittaway, National RWNZ Councillor for the Southern Region. <br> </p> 
<p> 
 <c>
  <img src="/events/TripleF4.JPG?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=400" width="400"> 
 </c> <br> </p> 
<p>A tradition of the Triple F is an introduction to the sport of curling at the International Rink in Naseby. “With Otago’s Scottish Heritage, this is a very fitting sport to participate in, and the enthusiasm and noise that is generated has to be experienced.” Says Margaret.</p> 
<p>“Since its inception in 2007, the region has hosted nearly 500 participants and raised over $10,000 for charities. This year the charity of choice was the Blind Foundation. Its popularity keeps growing under the guidance of our Committee Camp Mother, Pat Macaulay and planning is already underway for 2017!”</p>

        <title>Afghanistan Country of Study 2015 - Goat farmers market luxury cashmere</title>
        <date>Tuesday, May 12, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Afghan with goat.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img style="border-style: solid; width: 300px; height: 200px; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; float: left;" src="/images/blog/Afghan with goat.jpg" unselectable="on">"Not so long ago, Afghan farmers collected the thick winter undercoat their goats shed every spring and threw it on the fire to heat their homes and cook their food. 
<br>Some have since learned that the super-soft fluff that comes off in clumps as the weather warms up, once cleaned, refined and spun into yarn is cashmere." 
<br> 
<br>Afghan cashmere has found customers as far away as the United States, Britain and Europe. It's changed life for goat herders like Mohammad Amin. He has 120 goats grazing the open spaces around an industrial park on the outskirts of the western city of Herat. At this time of year, most of the female goats have kids and shed the cashmere, which Amin pulls off in huge handfuls. 
<br> 
<br>With an extended family of 13, he has a guaranteed income from the best of the cashmere he harvests as traders, processors, donors and international businesses are cottoning on to Afghanistan's potential as a major producer. 
<br> 
<br>"Buyers come to us and buy the good quality cashmere, the rest we take to the market and sell," Amin said. 
<br> 
<br>Each animal yields up to 250 grams of cashmere, Amin said. Each season he can earn more than $1,100 USD in a country where the annual national average is less than $700 USD. 
<br> 
<br>Only about 30-40 percent of Afghanistan's 7 million goats are combed for cashmere, according to estimates by the World Bank and the U.S. Agency for International Development, even though up to 95 percent of the animals could become part of the production chain. Most of the raw product is bought by traders who sell it to Chinese buyers to produce clothing. 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan is the world's third biggest producer of cashmere, its 1,000 metric tons a year, worth $30 million, accounts for 7 percent of the global market though it lags far behind China's 70 percent and Mongolia's 15 percent. 
<br> 
<br>The Afghan government, recognizing potential, recently came up with a "cashmere action plan," aiming to target the highest end of the global luxury market" where a designer-label cashmere sweater can cost $1,000 USD. 
<br> 
<br>But it's a long haul. Afghanistan remains a country in conflict after almost 40 years of war and few foreign investors are prepared to face such an insecure and uncertain environment, even if it's to exploit world-class oil and mineral resources, or agricultural products such as pomegranates, saffron and cashmere. Long-term, it could be a self-sustaining industry in Afghanistan, one that will create jobs, including work for women, generally marginalized in this society. 
<br> 
<br>Cashmere is not a wool but a hair, which accounts for its unique characteristics compared to sheep's wool, soft and fine in texture, light and strong at the same time. In the near-sterile conditions at a processing plant, the grimy, matted raw goat coat is washed and the long hair is separated from the cashmere. 
<br> 
<br>The cashmere is repeatedly refined, becoming increasingly gossamer-like as it is transformed into the highest quality, pristine, aerated fluff. It is then baled and sent to Europe, ready to be spun into yarn that can be dyed and knitted or woven into fabric, carpets and clothing. 
<br> 
<br>A small spinning operation in Kabul called Qaria has had success with a three-month pilot program spinning the cashmere into yarn and dying it using plant-based colorants sourced locally, such as saffron and indigo. 
<br> 
<br>Briton James Blewett, a partner in Qaria, says they have orders for the yarn from America, Britain and Europe, where it is gaining popularity in knitting shops. Qaria yarn sold out within hours at a recent wool trade fair in Britain, he said. 
<br> 
<br>Blewett said the company's first hand-knitted garments could be on sale later this year, carrying with them hopes of cashmere excellence with a label bearing a stylized goat's head, with the words "Afghan Made."

        <body><![CDATA[<img style="padding: 5px; float: left;" src="/images/blog/Liz evans_small.jpg" unselectable="on"> 
<p>Former Rural Women NZ National President Liz Evans has become an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her services to rural women.</p> 
<p>Liz was among 22 other New Zealanders who received awards from Governor-General Sir Jerry Mateparae at an investiture ceremony in Wellington on Tuesday, 19 May 2015.</p> 
<p>When she received her award the Governor-General personally extended his apologies to her for the absence of his wife Lady Janine Mateparae, who is the patron of Rural Women but could not attend the ceremony, Evans said.</p> 
<p>Liz has been a champion for Rural Women since she was introduced to the organisation when she married farmer Geoff Evans in 1974. Life on a farm was&nbsp;a huge change from her work as a reporter at the Marlborough Express. Highlights of her many achievements include her role in establishing the Enterprising Rural Women Awards. Liz was Provincial Secretary of Marlborough Rural Women for 10 years and served as National President from 2010-2013.</p> 
<p>Liz is now a life member and a voice for all rural women and communities. The honour is well-earned!</p>]]></body>

        <title>Good Management Practices Guide launched relating to Water Quality</title>
        <date>Friday, May 29, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/E-newsletter/good-management-practices-2015-small.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=294</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/E-newsletter/good-management-practices-2015-small.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=294" style="border-style: solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 9px; margin-right: 9px;" width="294">A new guide for&nbsp;good management practices for farmers&nbsp;has been launched by the&nbsp;primary industries.</p> 
<p>The new definitions were developed&nbsp;in collaboration with&nbsp;Environment Canterbury,&nbsp;AgResearch, Plant and Food Research and Landcare Research. It is a key part of the Matrix of Good Management (MGM) project which is being developed for the Canterbury region.</p> 
<p>Federated Farmers’ environment spokesperson Ian Mackenzie who is a member of the cross-sector governance group for the Canterbury MGM project, says the New Zealand public’s concern about water quality and environmental stewardship has made it imperative for farmers to show they are getting land, plant and nutrient management right.</p> 
<p>He says this has been defined by a range of primary sector industry groups as “good management practice” in a summary that is “the first of its kind”. “This document goes beyond a list of practices that are good for water quality and outlines a suite of good management practices that all farmers, regardless of sector, are expected to achieve.</p> 
<p>“As a first step to get all farmers up to a high standard of environmental awareness, we needed to agree as a sector what good management practice looks like. We have to involve farmers in that process to help us define that in very practical terms. We are now well on the way to getting industry-wide agreement on what ‘good’ looks like in terms of farming that protects water quality.”</p> 
<p>Mr Mackenzie says the good management practices detailed in the new document are a comprehensive list of the outcomes that all farmers, wherever they are in New Zealand, could reasonably be expected to achieve.</p> 
<p>“The summary has been prepared over the past 18 months with discussions at farmer workshops and with individual farmers, rural professionals and industry representatives. We’ve tested this with different groups including leading farmers to make sure it’s practical and doable. We want to get some consistency in everyone’s approach to this multi-dimensional topic.</p> 
<p>“It’s tough for farmers if they keep getting mixed or confused messages from different bodies. We hope this document will give farmers some certainty on what they need to concentrate on to lift environmental performance. The public can also see the kind of responsible farming practices that are needed to protect water quality,” he says. “This will be an evolving suite of tools and practical measures that the industry can develop as we learn new practices and science.”</p> 
<p>Two examples of the good management practices listed in the new guide include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Locate and manage farm tracks, gateways, water troughs, self-feeding areas, stock camps, wallows and other sources of run-off to minimise risks to water quality.</li> 
 <li>Manage the amount and timing of fertiliser inputs, taking account of all sources of nutrients, to match plant requirements and minimise risk of losses.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Mr Mackenzie says the summary has been approved by a cross-sector governance stakeholder group, which includes senior representatives from industry, government and the community.</p> 
<p>“The details on how exactly the good management practices will be used and reflected in council plans and policies are still being worked through with everyone. However their successful uptake will need to be underpinned by industry extension programmes for farmers and supported by farm environment plans,” he says.</p>

        <title>Stress and depression unwelcome visitors</title>
        <date>Thursday, June 25, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/blog/flood.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/flood.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182" width="182" style="border-style: solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 9px; margin-right: 9px;">Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) is concerned that as rural people clean up after the disastrous floods, and snow, their resilience and resourcefulness will be challenged by overwhelming distress.</p> 
<p>For farming families in more remote areas their sense of isolation will become acute resulting in anxiety and depression. It is a problem that will go beyond the farm gate.</p> 
<p><span>“However, it will be women who will put their own well-being on hold, ensuring their partners’ cope.” Says Health Portfolio spokesperson Margaret Pittaway. “This is not new, research shows that rural women play a major role in achieving resilience in rural communities beginning in the family home, and yet at the same time are vulnerable given their distance from neighbours and support. This vulnerability will extend beyond the disaster as partners have difficulty getting their lives back to normal.”</span> </p> 
<p><span>Rural Women New Zealand encourages GPs and mental health teams to check on the well-being of the carer, the partner of the person who has come into their care. “And to remember that stress and anxiety won’t wash down the drain along with the melting snow, floodwaters and silt. It may continue for many months becoming even more acute as time goes on”, says Ms Pittaway, “Ongoing pastoral care will be essential.”</span> </p> 
<p><span>Rural Women New Zealand has a Community Fund to provide financial assistance to where there is an identified urgent need. The grant may be awarded to assist families in time of natural disaster such as the floods and snows, or to assist an individual with a specific need.

        <title>Hawera Branch celebrates its 90th birthday</title>
        <date>Monday, July 13, 2015</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/cake.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182" width="182" style="border-style: solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 9px; margin-right: 9px;"> </p> 
<p>Hawera has the oldest branch of Rural Women New Zealand and celebrated its 90th birthday with a big party in early July.</p> 
<p>Club president Nancy Riddick wrote that 90 years ago the branch's first president, Florence Carter, stood on Patterson's Corner, in the main street of Hawera, with a piece of paper and pencil, and asked for 2 shillings and sixpence from women who passed by to become members of the Women's Division of the Farmers Union, as it was then known.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the early years rural&nbsp;women carried out considerable charitable&nbsp;work. During the depression a large amount of clothing was collected and given to needy families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In 1931 the Hawera branch made valuable contribution to those affected by the Napier earthquake with truck loads of cheese, butter, eggs, bacon and numerous other foods, clothing and medical supplies.&nbsp;</p>]]></body>

        <title>Rural Women NZ 90 Year Anniversary</title>
        <date>Wednesday, July 29, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Florence Polsen Panel 1.JPG?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/Florence Polsen Panel 1.JPG?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182" width="182" style="border-style: solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 9px; margin-right: 9px;">As we celebrate our 90th year we thought it was time to look back and tell the stories of the extraordinary women who grew this organisation into what it is today.&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 In 1925 William Polson, President of the New Zealand Farmers Union (NZFU) warned that 'several ladies intended to be in Wellington during the New Zealand Farmers Union Conference week'. The NZFU subsequently invited these women to a tea-party at the DIC department store on 27 July. 
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>The following day the women met separately to form the Women's Division of the NZFU (WDFU), electing Florence Polson (pictured)&nbsp;as president. The organisation aimed to find ways of improving living conditions on New Zealand farms and support the NZFU. 29th July 1925 the WDFU was officially founded.
</div> 
<div>
 Florence had been voicing her beliefs about the needs of rural women by for several years through writing for the New Zealand Farmers' Advocate, under the pseudonyms 'Martha' and 'Columbine', she described the hardships and loneliness of women living on back-blocks farms. 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 <span style="color: rgb(75, 172, 198);">Too much church, children and kitchen…..</span> 
</div> 
<div>
 Florence was concerned about farm women's lack of financial independence, she had an idea that rural wives could sell produce to townswomen and called for greater help in the home. She thought that the rural wife was taken for granted by her farmer husband and his union because there was 'too much church, children, and kitchen about his attitude.' 
 <br> 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 <span style="color: rgb(75, 172, 198);">The Bush Nurse and Housekeeper Scheme</span> 
</div> 
<div>
 When William travelled overseas, Florence went with him to study rural women's organisations. She returned in 1926 with plans for bush-nurse and housekeeper schemes to be run by the WDFU. These were implemented in 1927. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Florence also followed up on her ideas introduced a market system, the Women's Exchange, which enabled farm women to sell produce, and with Henrietta Jackson devised the rules and constitution for the WDFU. She set up a travelling book club in Marton and encouraged the WDFU to lobby government for more maternity homes and rural dental clinics.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>The first Annual General Meeting of the WDFU was held on the 4th August 1926. Mrs J G Coates, wife of the Prime Minister opened proceedings. There was an address by the Mr F C Brown Chief Poultry Instructor, the name of the organisation was confirmed, issues discussed were Help to Boy Immigrants; Medical Attention to Country School Children; Bibles in Schools; and Legislation for more Maternity Homes. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Florence’s work sometimes caused controversy and her abilities were not always appreciated. In January 1928, for instance, the WDFU executive was embroiled in a row over how the housekeeper scheme should be managed, and some members thought her too autocratic. She was returned as president in July 1928, but illness forced her to resign in 1929. She really had not recovered from the death of her son Donald aged 15, in a shooting accident in December 1927. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 In 1933 Florence sought re-election as president of the WDFU but was unsuccessful, partly because she was opposed by a group of members who were strong believers in eugenics. These women were influenced by Nina Barrer and were keen to reinstate the dropped clauses of the 1928 Mental Defectives Amendment Act. Florence was seen as a threat to their aims. Florence Polson died on 14 May 1941 at Wanganui.
</div> 
<div>
 ------
</div> 
<div>
 Over the years there have been huge successes for the organisation and eventually it became known as Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ). 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <p> "Some of those successes achieved during our 90 year history include funds raised for a Spitfire to support the war effort, significant fundraising for leptospirosis research, cot death research, a mobile library service, and support for communities during adverse events. Life is very different today for families on farms but there are still challenges," says RWNZ National President Wendy McGowan. <br> </p> 
 <p>"Mental well-being has become a significant concern, along with family violence, biosecurity issues and limited access to adult learning opportunities for rural women. These are just some of the many issues we are addressing today as an authentic advocate for rural communities. Our advocacy role in rural health, education, safety and environmental issues make our organisation as relevant today as it was in 1925," says Ms McGowan.</p>

        <title>ERWA winners success continues for Dove River Peonies</title>
        <date>Tuesday, August 11, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Dove Peonies small_big2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=325</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/Dove Peonies small_big2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=325" width="325" style="border-style: solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 9px; margin-right: 9px;"> </p> 
<p>Dot Kettle and Georgia Richards of Dove River Peonies gained a Merit Award at last year’s Enterprising Rural Women Awards. Here they explain what’s happened to their business since and why they are encouraging others to enter the awards. </p> 
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Winning the award was a watershed moment for our company Dove River Peonies. Despite having only launched our 100% natural skin care repair products in October last year, we decided to enter. Thanks to the publicity and credibility we got from the award, our business growth has been 6 fold.</span></span> </p> 
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">The awards entry process helped us succinctly identify where we wanted to take our business, the challenges we would need to address, and the opportunities we could embrace to get there. It was inspiring and energising to put that on paper and then having the chance to talk that through with the judging panel really challenged us to step up and commit.</span></span> </p> 
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Receiving a merit award at the Awards dinner was a humbling experience. We got to hear from the category winners about their inspiring business journeys and share our own. Meeting delegates from all around the country and sharing our story of turning our peony flower farm into a natural skin care cream to treat our son’s eczema was both a fantastic opportunity and an amazing experience. </span></span> </p> 
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">The awards generated huge interest in our products – and as a direct consequence we were approached by Lifestyle Magazine where editor Nadene Hall showcased our business – with a 12 page colour spread. This led to a big spike in our sales – and was subsequently placed on the Stuff website. The impact was immediate. We went from a best ever website daily hits of 600 to 6000 hits. And the orders started from 6am and continued at an order a minute. We sold out of our stock twice over in that single day. Fortunately we were able to produce more crème quickly with our Nelson based natural products manufacturer and meet the orders within an acceptable time frame.</span></span> </p> 
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">We wouldn’t have got that publicity without entering the awards. And still to this day we use our entry form as a benchmark for our business progress and a reminder of our values, aspirations and plan for the future.</span></span> </p> 
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">So thank you Rural Women – and to all the rural women in business wondering if they should enter the Enterprising Rural Women Awards - just do it! We can’t guarantee your experience will be the same as ours but we are 100% confident that it will be good for your business and one of the most worthwhile investments in your business you will make. - <em>Dot Kettle and Georgia Richards </em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span> </p>]]></body>

        <title>All about Afghanistan talk on Great Barrier Island</title>
        <date>Tuesday, August 11, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Afghan2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=348</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/Afghan2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=348" width="348" style="border-style: solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 9px; margin-right: 9px;"> </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand chooses a country of study each year, and in 2015 it is Afghanistan.</p> 
<p><strong></strong> </p> 
<p>A young Afghani women Lima Maywand, flew from the Auckland to speak to Awana Rural Women members at their June meeting on Great Barrier Island. </p> 
<p>It was Lima’s first trip out of Auckland since she arrived in NZ 12 years ago at the age of eight. She told the 18 Rural Women members and nine guests about how her family came to NZ and the challenges of both getting out of Afghanistan and migrating to a new country and culture.</p> 
<p>Lima was lucky, her NZ based uncle found her family in a refugee camp in Pakistan where Lima and her family had lived for 4 years. Lima, her brother, mother and father all came to NZ but her father, a surgeon, could not cope with being unable to practice as a doctor and went back to Afghanistan and to his former career.</p> 
<p>Lima’s mother found leaving her homeland difficult but Lima has thrived and after being very successful at Rutherford High School (she was a prefect) is now doing a degree in psychology at Weltec. She hopes to work in prisons in the future and in particular with Middle Eastern men in prison.</p> 
<p>Lima spoke about the customs, culture and food in Afghanistan. She was particularly enthusiastic about the beautiful clothes worn on special occasions and the diet which is rich in meat and rice. She also spoke very movingly about the contrast between the Afghanistan her mother knew and the Afghanistan of today. Women no longer have the freedom to dress as they choose and must be fully covered in public, the beauty of cities has been destroyed, and education is now minimal and for women, rare. Lima said many refugees are waiting for the country to change so they can return but she feels like – and is - a Kiwi and is fully appreciative of what our country can offer. </p> 
<p>Lima was a very impressive young woman and open to the many questions the audience asked. The discussion continued with Marion Snow talking about her niece who was a volunteer worker in Afghanistan, and Ngaire Avery talking about her time in Afghanistan. Ngaire also brought along the clothing worn by women in the home and Awana Rural Women members made posters of various aspects of Afghanistan. </p> 
<p>Thanks to the Office of Ethnic Affairs which found Lima to come and talk to us and the Northern Region of Rural Women paid for her airfare. Awana Rural Women on the Island hosted Lima overnight and took her touring around the Island.</p>

        <title>Review of Family Violence Legislation - have your say</title>
        <date>Friday, August 14, 2015</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="/drought domestic violence image.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-right: 8px;">The Ministry of Justice is consulting on the way our legal system deals with family violence and seeks your views on a range of ideas. <br> </p> 
<p>These ideas include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Better guidance in law about family violence and the expectations about how the government will respond. <br> </li> 
 <li>More visibility in law to the population groups affected by family violence. <br> </li> 
 <li>Creating additional pathways for victims, perpetrators, and the wider family who seek help without having to go to court. <br> </li> 
 <li>Improving protection orders including how applications are funded <br> </li> 
 <li>Creation of a new framework of family violence offences. <br> </li> 
 <li>Supporting improvements to the whole of government response to family violence.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<div>
 &nbsp; 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Research indicates rural New Zealand has on average a higher level of reported family violence than urban New Zealand. However, because of the lack of services and support and the isolating nature of rural, more domestic violence goes unreported, therefore your feedback is important.
</div>

 <br>Rural Women NZ have put a submission forward to the Ministry of Justice,&nbsp;

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/Heather Leong crop1 (00000002).jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=204" style="border-style: solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-right: 8px;" width="204">The&nbsp;2015 Rural Women NZ and Access Homehealth scholarship has been awarded to Waikato nurse Heather Leong.</p> 
<p>Heather is currently a Community Registered Nurse working for Access Homehealth Midland Region and is also self-employed, providing nutrition and lifestyle advice. She will use the $3000 scholarship to help fund her studies to complete an International Integrative Nurse Coach Certificate in the United States.</p> 
<p>Heather’s goals are to build on her skills in wellness education to promote and support holistic health in the rural community. The coaching certificate integrates health promotion strategies with traditional therapies. </p> 
<p>“I intend to use the coaching certificate alongside current medical practices, coaching rural clients in Waipa with chronic health conditions such as heart disease to makes changes, where necessary, to their usual practices and improve their status.”</p> 
<p>Access Homehealth CEO, Graeme Titcombe, says, “Heather was selected as support resources are often scarce or limited in rural and remote areas, as is education on how to manage these issues. The coaching certificate is relevant to restorative and enablement programmes that already exist in New Zealand home based health services and Heather will benefit from learning about international advances and applying those techniques in her rural community.”</p> 
<p>The annual Rural Women NZ and Access Homehealth scholarship is awarded to a health worker who wishes to further their health or disability studies at post-graduate level, with a focus on the rural sector. Heather was chosen from a strong field of 32 applicants.</p> 
<p>Heather is planning to travel to the United States to complete the certificate in 2016.</p>

        <title>Pandemic on Great Barrier Island - Awana Branch event</title>
        <date>Friday, September 11, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/pandemic2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=391</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/pandemic2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=391" width="391" style="border-style: solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-right: 8px;">Imagine&nbsp;a global pandemic that swept the world, killing everyone in its wake.</p> 
<p>Imagine if Great Barrier Island was the only place to be successfully isolated from the virus, leaving the 900 residents to rebuild humanity.</p> 
<p>Awana Branch of Rural Women NZ will pose this scenario to four experts at the No Barriers - small Island, big ideas panel discussion exploring pandemics on Saturday 12 September.</p> 
<p>The panelists will give insight into how such a pandemic would play out. The panelists include Virologist Associate Professor Lance Jennings, John Titmus Civil Defence Northern Regional Coordinator, Disaster Researcher Professor David Johnston, and Young Adult Fantasy writer Karen Healey. The panel will be moderated by well-known microbiologist, Dr Siouxsie Wiles. Also in attendance will be Civil Defence Minister and local MP Nikki Kaye.</p> 
<p>The event is not as far-fetched as it seems. The last major global pandemic in 1918 killed an estimated 20-40 million people and was notorious for its rapid onset and progression to respiratory failure and death. The highest number of deaths occurred in the 20-40 age group.</p> 
<p>"The scenario is not entirely impossible," says Dr Lance Jennings. "Isolating Great Barrier Island as a sanctuary is perfectly feasible." Dr Jennings added that if a pandemic did get out of hand, Civil Defence would take over much of the running of the country, including isolating communities to contain the virus.</p> 
<p>Professor Johnston knows the challenges communities face in times of disaster, having focused his research on human responses to natural disasters and crisis decision-making. "Communities can be amazingly resilient in times of disaster - especially without the interference of bureaucracy," says Professor Johnston.</p> 
<p>Karen Healey will be discussing the "what ifs." What if the bad guys take over Great Barrier? What if a resident’s best friend tries to sneak onto the Island? What if the young residents decide to kill all the old ones?</p> 
<p>The aim of the event is to make people aware of disaster preparedness through a scenario that will capture people’s imagination. It is a free event and off-Islanders are welcome. Be there and survive!</p>]]></body>

        <title>Whananaki School wins top spot in HP Rural Schools competition</title>
        <date>Monday, September 14, 2015</date>

Northland's Whananaki School won top spot taking away $10,000 worth of HP Technology. 
<p>Waimata School in Waihi came second, Otamarakau School in Bay of Plenty third and Weedons School in Christchurch and Toko School in Taranaki shared fourth equal.</p> 
<p>All five schools are worthy recipients of a share in the $20,000 worth of <span><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/Admin/hp.co.nz">HP New Zealand</a></span> products and support.</p> 
<p>Earlier this year, HP New Zealand teamed up with Rural Women New Zealand to give rural primary schools the chance to win a share of $20,000 worth of HP products and support. To enter, schools were asked to submit an entry explaining why they needed new technology and how it would benefit the students.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can watch the videos here: <span><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/Admin/undefined">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRBWd0s2jCKwbfiA-KRS8IC45RWjMUqsv</a></span> </p> 
<div> 
 <br>Whananaki School Principal Shaun Tepania says he is thrilled to be able to provide new technology for his growing school.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>"We have had a significant roll increase and have doubled the size of our school since last year. Now we will be able to provide devices that support and engage all children's learning and our staff will have opportunities to develop e-learning throughout their class programmes.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>“This is an amazing opportunity for our school and community. We would like to thank HP and Rural Woman NZ for creating a competition that gives rural schools that extra support," he says.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>Year eight student Anika Read, one of the students who helped create the school’s winning entry, says she is excited about the opportunities new technology can bring.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>"We’ll get our work done faster, independently and working collaboratively in groups,” she says.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>Whananaki School’s entry was one of more than 80 creative video submissions from rural schools across the country. Judges, including a Rural Women New Zealand representative, had the tough job of narrowing down the entries to five winning schools. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 An HP representative visited Whananaki School in August to interview the principal, meet with students and understand the technology needs of the school.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>HP Category Manager Victoria Mahan says the second year of the competition has reinforced the hunger for technology by students and teachers alike.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>“It’s exciting to see how enthusiastically these young students respond to using technology to really enhance their learning,” she says. “Now with the roll out of ultra-fast broadband, schools are building their IT capability and latching on to technology in the classroom – it’s really encouraging.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>“In this ever-increasing digital world it is imperative that all students are given the best tools to learn and excel. If they don’t have this they run the real risk of getting left behind at school and when they enter the workforce,” adds Victoria. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
</div> 
<div>
 Rural Women NZ education spokesperson, Kerry Maw, says “We are delighted to be part of this initiative. It’s going to be interesting to watch some of these schools gain confidence and opportunities through new technology products and the increased learning opportunities that come with them."&nbsp;

        <title>Aorere River Restoration Prize wins international award</title>
        <date>Thursday, September 24, 2015</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="/images/Barbara Stuart v2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182" width="182" style="border-style: solid; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; float: left; margin-bottom: 9px; margin-right: 9px;">NZ Landcare Trust's Aorere River Project has won the inaugural Morgan Foundation NZ River<em>prize&nbsp;</em>at the International River<em>s Symposium</em> Gala Dinner in Brisbane.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NZ Landcare Trust CEO Dr Nick Edgar accepted the award on behalf of the Aorere River Initiative.<em>“I think this is a real victory for community-led grassroots river management in New Zealand. Without the Aorere river community, the story really wouldn’t have happened.”</em> </p> 
<p>After the awards Dr Edgar highlighted the contribution of Barbara Stuart, a long-time Rural Women NZ member,&nbsp;<em>"I'd particularly like to congratulate Barbara Stuart, NZ Landcare Trust Regional Coordinator for the Top of the South, for the incredible job she has done, helping to bring together the Aorere community and encouraging them to solve problems and take positive action."</em>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Farmer spokesperson and dairy farmer Sue Brown has been instrumental in the success of the Aorere project. Sue was pleased and a little surprised to hear the Aorere project had won, given the scale of the other projects in the final four.<em>"Our project is a community approach to catchment wellbeing. It's a story of the dairy industry and the shellfish industry coming together and looking at the catchment as a whole."</em> </p> 
<p>The Aorere River Catchment lies within the Tasman District of New Zealand’s South Island and is home to over 13,000 cows and 35 dairy farms. The Aorere River suffered from serious bacterial contamination, which in turn had a negative impact on aquaculture including the mussel and cockle farms in the Ruataniwha estuary. NZ Landcare Trust played a lead role in bringing different stakeholders together and supporting farmers in the region to set up the Aorere Catchment Group. NZ Landcare Trust worked with farmers to develop on-farm environmental plans, provide project coordination and act as brokers, facilitators and supporters to the farming community.</p> 
<p>The results were outstanding, thanks to the proactive response from local dairy farmers. The project not only improved the ecological health of the river and coastal environment but also created community cohesion, assisting dairy and marine farmers to coexist and maintain their livelihoods sustainably.</p>

<p><strong>Bronwyn Muir - &nbsp;</strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">OnFarm Safety New Zealand</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Eltham</strong> </p> 
<p><strong><u><a href="http://www.onfarmsafety.co.nz/">www.onfarmsafety.co.nz</a></u></strong> </p> 
<p>OnFarmSafety New Zealand was conceived to assist farm businesses to understand current farm health and safety legislation and prepare the rural community for new legislation. It started from Bronwyn Muir helping out one farmer who said that she explained the legislation well and there is a need for farmers to understand health and safety law. </p> 
<p>Three years on, OnFarmSafety NZ has turned into a sustainable business. Bronwyn and staff take time to explain and support each farmer client through education on specific health and safety acts, codes, regulations and technical advice. Bronwyn and her team continue to create new ways and tools to assist the farmer to achieve health and safety compliance. </p>

<p><strong><u><a href="http://www.carvinstreetwear.co.nz/">www.carvinstreetwear.co.nz</a></u></strong> </p> 
<p>Carvin Streetwear is a fashion clothing, footwear and accessories store based in Gore. Chanelle was motivated to start up a fashion clothing store as farm duties did not allow enough time to travel further afield than Gore for shopping trips. After moving from the surfing region of Taranaki she recognised a gap in the market for streetwear fashion in Gore. </p> 
<p>Carvin Streetwear opened in 2005 with Chanelle and two part-time staff and has evolved over the years and is now located in a premium retail space with full time staff who have completed retail industry training. In the past year staff have won a retail professional service award and the shop was awarded Top Shop for Otago and Southland and were runners-up for the Supreme Top Shop Award. </p>

<p><strong>Collingwood</strong> </p> 
<p><strong><a href="http://www.bayfitness.co.nz/">www.bayfitness.co.nz</a></strong> </p> 
<p>Renee Riley’s fitness business started nearly four years ago when she moved to Collingwood. Her husband did not need extra help on the farm so she wanted to find a career. She had trained as a personal trainer when she was younger but working in a big gym was not her style. She did some research about Collingwood and realized there were no options for locals to do fitness classes in their community. </p> 
<p>Renee started off with a circuit strength training class at a local school hall which grew into several classes a week and personal training sessions. Eventually she leased a bigger hall and converted it into a gym with equipment. She now runs small group classes, including an “Easy Does It” class for older, less mobile people, as well as bootcamps and a women’s retreat. </p>

<p>Plant Hawke’s Bay is a native plant nursery specialising in growing eco-sourced Hawke’s Bay plants. Marie set up the company in 2005 with the objective to see more Hawke’s Bay plants going back into the local landscape. Marie has extensive knowledge of the distribution of native plants throughout the area after working for the QE II Trust for several years. </p> 
<p>They grow around 85,000 plants a year on leased land. They sell wholesale plants and contract grow for farmers, lifestyle block owners, landscapers and for conservation projects like the kakabeak restoration. About 95 percent of plants are eco-sourced by collecting the seed and cuttings from natural plants in the wild. Marie’s business aims to be the preferred supplier of native plants, have a profitable and sustainable business and to help save plant species. </p>

<p><strong>Holly Tonkin - &nbsp;</strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">Avocado Contracting</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Whangarei</strong> </p> 
<p><strong></strong> </p> 
<p>Holly Tonkin has been avocado contracting for five years. Holly grew up in the rural sector but pursued other careers until her mother asked her to help pick avocados. She loved it and enjoyed being outdoors and soon found a job as a picker for avocados in Whangarei.</p> 
<p>Holly now owns a business using hydralada’s which are elevated working platforms, and a transport trailer to move between jobs. Her clients include 20 avocado orchards and her main job is harvesting and managing staff to do the picking. Holly also undertakes pruning and general nursery tasks. Her clients have said that she has proved to be careful and respectful of the orchard and strives to avoid breakage and damage to orchard trees. </p>

<p><strong><br>Marion Williams- &nbsp;</strong><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">Marion Williams Counselling</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Fairlie</strong> </p> 
<p><strong><u></u></strong> </p> 
<p>Marion Williams worked on a farm with her family for a decade and the reality hit hard as drought, floods and snow storms affected the farm. After completing a BA degree in applied psychology she applied for a position at a community based rural counselling service. She worked part-time and gained accreditation with the New Zealand Association of Counsellors and other industry organisations. </p> 
<p>In 2002 Marion sold the farm and now focuses on counselling. The foundation of her services is built on her experience and knowledge of rural culture and the gaps that the culture has created when it comes to acknowledging and talking about emotional health. The economic benefits to rural and urban communities in addressing emotional health through counselling are immeasurable. </p>

<p><strong>Joanne Taylor</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Latitude Media</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Canterbury</strong> </p> 
<p><a href="http://www.latitudemagazine.co.nz/"><strong>www.latitudemagazine.co.nz</strong></a> </p> 
<p>Latitude Media was started from home by Joanne Taylor in 2007. She co-owns the business with her husband Deane but is solely responsible for the operational side of the business. They are also arable farmers who produce vegetable seed. The motivation to set up a magazine was to provide upmarket material for local women to read, especially in the rural areas of Canterbury.</p> 
<p>Joanne Taylor filled a gap in the market for a high end magazine with inspiring real stories about local people written for a female rural audience. There are regular advertisers who have been with the magazine for over eight years. In every issue they feature a local charity, food producer and stories on art, history and culture. The one constant has to be a connection to Canterbury.</p>

        <title>Ann Irving wins medal for wetland work</title>
        <date>Monday, November 16, 2015</date>
        <img>/images/Ann1.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=247</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Ann1.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=247" width="247" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-right: 8px;><p> Southland member Ann Irving has received a national Walking Access Award in recognition of her efforts towards obtaining public access to one of the few remaining flax wetlands in Southland.<p>The wetland is located in Rural Women New Zealand's forestry block in Dipton, and Mrs Irving has been working with Environment Southland, landowner Alan Maxwell and the <a href=" https:="" www.walkingaccess.govt.nz="" title="NZ Walking Access Commission"> </p> 
<p> Southland resident Ann Irving received a national Walking Access Award.</p> 
<p> The award is in recognition of her efforts towards obtaining public access to one of the few remaining flax wetlands in Southland. The wetland is located in&nbsp;Rural Women New Zealand's forestry block in Dipton, and Mrs Irving has been working with Environment Southland, landowner Alan Maxwell and the Walking Access Commission to create a legally enduring 150 metre track giving access to it.</p> 
<p>New Zealand Walking Access Commission regional field advisor for Queenstown Lakes and Southland, Ange van der Laan, says Mrs Irving has been working tirelessly to make the walkway a reality. </p> 
<p>“The possibility of the wetland being opened for public access is now there, and that is largely due to Ann’s tenacity, patience and commitment,” Ms van der Laan says. Mrs Irving, who is secretary of the Rural Women New Zealand Southland Forestry Committee, says she has always been interested in conservation and is humbled by the award. She stresses that the credit should also go to her colleagues at Rural Women New Zealand and to others in the community.</p> 
<p> “The award recognises the efforts of everyone involved. It’s been quite a big job,” she says. Mrs Irving acknowledged Mr Maxwell, the landowner who has agreed to the walkway going over his paddock and Environment Southland which had agreed to become the Controlling Authority of the walkway.</p> 
<p>Dipton Landcare Group and Dipton School had also played a major role and would soon roll out a weeding and planting programme for the walkway. New Zealand Walking Access Commission chief executive Mark Neeson says the Walking Access Awards recognise those who have made significant and lasting contributions to public access to the outdoors in New Zealand. These contributions can be through securing new legal access, championing public rights of access, trail building, or contributing to understanding of access rights and responsibilities. </p> 
<p>“The annual awards are an opportunity to acknowledge people in the community who are investing a great deal of time and effort to making walking easier, which in turn allows people to enjoy the outdoors,” Mr Neeson says.</p> 
<p> Mrs Irving received the award on Monday 16th November during an informal event at the Dipton Golf Club. MP Todd Barclay attended the event, as well as New Zealand Walking Access Commission operations manager Ric Cullinane</p>]]></body>

">Chanelle Purser owner of Carvin Streetwear in Gore has been awarded a Certificate for Emerging Enterprising Young Rural Woman.
<p>"The award gives me such pride, to be alongside the other fantastic finalists was an accolade in itself. Strong motivated woman doing great things for their rural community!</p> 
<p>"Receiving The Emerging Young Enterprising Rural Woman certificate, shows I have potential, to have that recognised is something special. </p> 
<p>"It’s that potential I want to work on, within my business and my community involvement, taking on more leadership roles and sharing my knowledge and skills I have learnt along the way.</p> 
<p>This award has highlighted my business as well as my community profile."</p> The Awards recognised six enterprising rural women throughout New Zealand. Wendy McGowan, National President Rural Women NZ was a judge on the panel and says, "Chanelle impressed us with her retail success and commitment to youth in rural communities." 
<div> 
 <p>Chanelle entered the awards very last minute after seeing a small article in her local paper, never expecting to receive a special award of recognition.&nbsp;"When I read the article I related to many of the comments and thought I’d give it ago not only for the experience but to benchmark my business and most of all network with other rural woman with off farm business like myself."</p> 
 <p>Chanelle is keen to&nbsp;continue to share her support, time and sponsorship within town and local rural communities. "I am keen to promote Rural Women NZ's diverse members, their values, history and just what they do within our communities and wider NZ. I enjoy connecting the urban and rural people and helping them understand our rural culture, I look forward to sharing what I have learnt so far about RWNZ."</p>

        <title>90th Anniversary end of year recap</title>
        <date>Thursday, December 17, 2015</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Cutting the Cake_web2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=247" width="247" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-right: 8px;">Rural Women New Zealand members can feel proud of their organisation’s achievements in its 90<sup style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">th&nbsp;</sup>year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You have been fundraising, baking and knitting for a variety of causes, including rescue helicopters, ambulance services, women’s refuges, rural firefighters, education providers and seasonal workers. Poppies were knitted and donated to the WW1 Centenary project and are on display at Waiouru Museum.</p> 
<p>The work continues to improve the social and economic outcomes for rural women and their communities. This year many of you attended seminars raising awareness of the signs of family violence in rural communities. The New Zealand Parliament was lobbied to amend the Domestic Violence Act 1995 to explicitly allow the protection of animals. Campaigning continues on school bus speed restrictions, equity in health services, education and access to broadband.</p> 
<p>This festive season, many farming families are under pressure due to financial strains resulting from adverse events such as drought, increased fire risk and low dairy pay-outs. Mental well-being and farm safety have been topics of discussion. Rural Women New Zealand also acknowledge the recent intense media coverage focused on farming practices.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand's vision is to be a positive influence on the environment for rural women and their communities. I urge you to connect with your rural community and show your support for farming families who may be experiencing difficult times or need company over the festive season. <br> <br>Photo: The 90th birthday cake was made by Melva Robb and cut by Jeanette, Kath and Peggy. <br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The award has already had a huge impact on me and my business, it has reinforced that anything is possible if you put your mind to it, and given me a huge boost in confidence. It was great to be part of the competition, and to meet the other entrants, and to listen to their stories and hear the way they talked about their businesses. "</p> 
<div>
 Marie said there's been an increase in her business. People have read about the competition in the local papers, and have been in contact about plants for next year. She says that it’s been wonderful to get such positive feedback from people.
</div> 
<p>Marie is keen to get involved in promoting Rural Women NZ, "I’m really keen to meet the Rural Women branches in Hawke’s Bay and talk to them about the competition (and my business) and to encourage other women in rural business to enter the competition. " <br> </p>

        <title>Bronwyn Muir - winner in Enterprising Rural Women Awards</title>
        <date>Tuesday, January 12, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/Bronwyn Muir_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=204&amp;height=204</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Bronwyn Muir_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=204&amp;height=204" width="204" style="margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; border-style: solid; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; float: left;" height="204">Bronwyn Muir won the "Help I need Somebody" category at the recent Enterprising Rural Women Awards for her business OnFarmSafety New Zealand.</p> 
<p style="font-family: Helvetica;">The business was conceived after Bronwyn Muir&nbsp;helped out one farmer to understand the current farm health and safety legislation. The farmer said that she explained the legislation clearly and there was a need for farmers to understand health and safety law. <br> </p> 
<p style="font-family: Helvetica;">Three years on, OnFarmSafety NZ has turned into a sustainable business. Bronwyn and staff take time to explain and support each farmer client through education on specific health and safety acts, codes, regulations and technical advice. Bronwyn and her team continue to create new ways and tools to assist the farmer to achieve health and safety compliance.</p> 
<p>Bronwyn entered the awards as she thought it would be "fantastic for her business to receive the recognition and national business exposure and also may encourage other rural women thinking of developing a business to do so, and enter these awards in the future.” </p> 
<p>“Health &amp; safety is currently very rural industry relevant and when I set my business up there was huge demand for health &amp; safety specialists, who understood the rural industry needs, to be able to help farmers with the huge challenge and be compliant with legislation. The award put the spotlight on our business and what we can offer any rural industry based business.” </p> 
<p>Bronwyn is currently the President for Taranaki Federated Farmers, a trustee of the Taranaki Rural Support Trust and through these roles have been very involved with Rural Women members in Taranaki and had some exposure to Rural Women nationally through the Taranaki Women In Farming group. </p> 
<p>“I see all our rural Taranaki-based organisations working closely together to support each other into a stronger collaborative position of influence, advocacy, and growing dynamic rural communities.” </p>

<p>Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy announced extra funding of up to $150,000 would go to local Rural Support Trusts, with $40,000 set aside for the North Canterbury trust. <br> </p>The extra $150,000 means about $350,000 has gone towards supporting the work of the Rural Support Trusts. Farmers also have access to IRD flexibility for tax payments during the drought. 
<p>Rural support trust leaders have been working closely with farmers to monitor their well being and directing them to relief assistance as well as organising community events and one-on-one mentoring. <br> </p> 
<p><b>Farmers needing more support are being urged to call their local rural support trust on 0800 787 254, and Federated Farmers is operating a drought feedline on 0800 376 844.</b> </p> 
<p style="font-family: Helvetica;">According to the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) weather forecasters are predicting that the El Nino conditions will continue through Summer and into Autumn 2016. &nbsp;El Nino 2015-2016 could rank among the four strongest El Nino events recorded.</p>

        <title>Women Walk the World 2016</title>
        <date>Thursday, January 21, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/WWTW Banner3_New.jpg? action=</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/WWTW Banner3_New.jpg? action=" thumbnail&algorithm="fill_proportional&amp;width=204&amp;height=204" width="204" style="border-style: solid; float: left;">Women Walk the World is an annual event, where women’s groups in many countries organise walks in their communities along local tracks and trails, to raise funds for the Associated Country Women of the World.</p> 
<p>It’s a great way to come together, catch up with friends and have some fun and healthy exercise along the way.</p>The date for the event is 
<strong>Friday 29 April</strong>– ACWW Day - though walks can take place at other dates around that time if more convenient. 
<div> 
 <br> 
 <h3>Here’s What You Do:</h3>1.Decide on a walk for your group. It can range from a stroll around the park, a hike through the bush, an amble around a neighbourhood or along a walkway. 
 <br>2.Invite others. This is a great way to reach out to new potential members, and include families and friends. 
 <br>3.Go to the 
 <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=212039" title="WWTW 2016 form ">online registration form</a>, fill it in and email&nbsp;
 <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e3868d92968a918a8690a3919691828f948c8e868dcd8c9184cd8d99">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&nbsp;or post to national office before your walk, so we know what walks are taking place and can promote them. 
 <div>
  4.We have 
  <strong>t shirts&nbsp;</strong>and 
  <strong>pedometers </strong>for groups that register. Initially one set per group on a first-come, first-served basis. These will be sent on receipt of your registration form.
 </div> 
 <div>
  5.The idea is to raise funds. This could be done through sponsorship, a gold coin donation, or perhaps an afternoon tea or sausage sizzle afterwards. Here is a 
  <a href="http://www.acww.org.uk/forms/acww_walk_sponsorshipform.pdf">sponsorship form</a> you can use.
 </div> 
 <div>
  6.Tally up the
  <strong> number of people</strong> who attend and the 
  <strong>distance walked.</strong> 
  <br>7.
  <strong>Take photos</strong> and send to national office so we can publicise your walks and use on our website and Facebook pages. Email 
  <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0d68637c78647f64687e4d7f787f6c617a6260686323627f6a23637723">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> 
  <br>8.Send your funds raised, and details of kilometres walked to national office.

        <title>Pesticides Research Study calling for participants</title>
        <date>Friday, January 29, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/pesticides.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=132</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/pesticides.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=132" width="132" style="border-style: solid;float:left;"> The Centre for Public Health Research at Massey University is inviting 900 children aged 5-11 years from across New Zealand to take part in a health research study.</p> 
<p>The research will look at how much New Zealand children are exposed to pesticides and whether this exposure has any effects on their brain and mental functions, and behaviours.</p> 
<p>To participate in the study three postal questionnaires will need to be completed by a parent or caregiver on behalf of the child. The first questionnaire will ask about potential sources of pesticide exposure, as well as questions about the parent/caregiver diet, home environment, and family health. The other two questionnaires will ask about the child’s behaviours. There is also a second phase of the study which will involve selected participants being tested with brain exercises measuring their understanding, behaviours and emotions.</p> 
<p>If you are interested in taking part, please read through the information sheet (<a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=208752">download here</a>) and contact the research coordinator Jean Feary Mckenzie on <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e389cd858682919a8e8088868d998a86a38e829090869acd8280cd8d99">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> or free phone 0800 990 053. A parent consent form will also need to be completed (<a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=208685" title="Pesticides Consent Form">download here</a>).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The information in the questionnaires will be confidential to the research team and at no time will individual information or names be made public. Please note that you have the right to decline to participate, refuse to answer any particular questions and withdraw from the study at any time.</p> 
<p>If you do not have children of the appropriate age to take part, please pass on this information to relatives or friends who are eligible and may be interested in the research study.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Children and E.coli</title>
        <date>Friday, February 05, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/blog/cows-71280x960.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=290</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img src="/images/blog/cows-71280x960.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=290" width="290" style="border-style: solid; float: left;"> 
<p>Do you know of any young children who have been very ill with E.coli O157:H7?</p> 
<p>How did they catch it? How soon after it was caught was it diagnosed?&nbsp;How bad was it for the child and their family?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a rural mother, National Councillor Fiona Gower recognises the need to keep children safe. She knows the dangers of quad bikes, tractors, water and animals as well as other hazards seen daily. But what of those that can’t be seen? Such as minute organisms hiding in mud and water and in animal urine and faeces. These are the bugs that if not dealt with can cause major illness and in some cases irreparable damage and even death. How do we protect our families from them? </p> 
<p>Rural Women NZ members are aware of Leptospirosis thanks to fundraising and awareness campaigns. But what about Salmonella and Rotovirus? The latest of the organisms to be targeted by awareness campaigns and research is E. coli O157:H7. </p> 
<p><strong>What is E.coli</strong> <strong>O157?</strong> </p> 
<p>E.coli O157:H7 (STEC or VTEC) is an intestinal pathogen that causes severe outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to severe bleeding from the bowel, to renal failure leading to transplants or dialysis. It has the most severe effect on children aged under 5 with 10% of cases hospitalised. There was one death in 2014. </p> 
<p>The most common risk factors reported for VTEC/STEC infection cases in 2014 were contact with pets, farm animals and animal manure. </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Kids on farms can be infected with E. coli O157:H7 </li> 
 <li>Children under 5 years old most susceptible to serious illness. </li> 
</ul> 
<p>This infection has been increasing since 1997 with 187 cases notified last year. </p> 
<p>STEC infects cattle and sheep, however animals will appear healthy. </p> 
<p><strong>How to keep your children safe:</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>As a veterinarian, RWNZ National Councillor Liz Hancock stresses that hygiene awareness is really important with any of these bugs. Thorough hand washing when coming inside from farm and basic hygiene (leave dirty gumboots and overalls outside) will reduce the opportunity for infection. </li> 
 <li>Parents need to be aware of how to try to prevent their children picking up these bugs. At this time of the year it is important to encourage hand washing, with children spending time in calf sheds and pet day animals and plenty of mud and water around. There are lots of opportunity to pick up bugs by ingestion or through the eyes and nose or cuts and grazes. </li> 
 <li>If a child has diarrhoea and has been in contact with animals, ask a doctor to test for E. coli O157:H7. If your child is very unwell, ask them to check for all the diseases. It is better to push for the test and be negative, than miss it and your child end up in hospital with complications from the disease. </li> 
 <li>Doctors who look after rural patients need to be aware of these organisms and be prepared to test. </li> 
</ul>

        <title>Vanuatu School thrilled with donations from Region 3</title>
        <date>Friday, February 26, 2016</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<img src="/images/vanuatu 2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=204" width="204" style="border-style: solid; float=right"> “The looks on the children’s faces when items were lifted out of the chest was priceless. Their eyes were big and smiles bigger.” 
<p>A chest of donated items has been given to Vanuatu’s Bush School which has about 30 children attending ranging from 6 years to 12 years. </p> 
<p>Matapua Branch and Region Three Rural Women NZ donated the goods to assist with the clean up after a devastating cyclone hit Vanuatu in 2015. </p> 
<p>Neville and Gloria Jones delivered the items to the children who “are very keen to learn. “ </p> 
<p>Neville was teaching before the cyclone but since then had been helping with constructing new buildings. Gloria helps with projects where possible. </p> 
<p>The school is still being built and there is no running water nearby so the children have to walk for 20 minutes one way to fill a water bottle from a small waterfall. They make this water last all day as it is very precious. </p> 
<p>Neville and Gloria said when the soap and flannels were handed out, the children just stood there smelling them. “They loved them. When they looked at the world globes they could not get over that Vanuatu was just a tiny spot compared to other countries in the world.” </p> 
<p>“They were all really thrilled to receive the chest of goodies and would like to thank Melva Robb, Matapua Branch and Region Three Rural Women NZ who donated goods for Vanuatu.” </p>

        <title>Changes to New Zealand Post charges</title>
        <date>Wednesday, March 16, 2016</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.nzpost.co.nz/tools/rate-finder" title="NZ Post"><img src="/images/letterbox.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=204" width="204" style="border-style: solid; float: left;"> </a>New Zealand Post have announced that the cost of sending a medium sized letter by Standard Post will increase 20 cents to $1 from 1 July 2016. 
<p>Prices will increase for both Standard Post and FastPost from 1 July. A medium sized letter sent within New Zealand will be $1 if sent by Standard Post. The cost of sending the same letter by FastPost will increase 40 cents to $1.80.</p> 
<p>There will also be increases for some international and business products including BoxLink, FreePost and Bulk Mail. A full list is available on the New Zealand Post website at <a href="http://www.nzpost.co.nz/july2016">www.nzpost.co.nz/july2016</a>.</p> 
<p>Domestic parcel prices will remain unchanged in 2016.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand National President Wendy McGowan says, "It is disappointing to hear of a price increase which will affect our already stressed rural communities. We encourage our members and community to ensure they are using the correct address format (<a href="https://www.nzpost.co.nz/personal/sending-within-nz/how-to-address-mail/standards-guides" title="NZ POST address ">click here</a>) and if you have any concerns or complaints to phone New Zealand Post's customer service line 0800 501 501."</p> 
<p>----</p> 
<p>The price changes follow on from the&nbsp;reduction in rural delivery services in November 2015.&nbsp;About six percent of NZ Post rural delivery customers are now on five-day delivery (Monday to Friday) in some rural areas near Auckland, Wellington, Whanganui, Rotorua, Havelock, Oamaru, Dunedin and Invercargill.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand believes it is important for the five day a week rural delivery service to remain unchanged in rural areas. </p> 
<p>National President Wendy McGowan says,"Rural delivery contractors provide a lifeline, delivering mail, supplies, spare parts, animal health remedies, medicines, and courier parcels.</p> 
<p>"The five day delivery and pick up service ensures people are able to run their farming enterprises and other rural businesses effectively, even from remote locations. These businesses breathe life into rural communities, as demonstrated through our Enterprising Rural Women Awards."</p> 
<p>In many rural areas there is still limited or no mobile phone coverage or broadband connections, "It is important to continue the five day delivery service for rural communities to remain connected," says Ms McGowan. </p>]]></body>

<p>“We’re absolutely thrilled Rural Women New Zealand have chosen to support <a href="http://www.lifeeducation.org.nz/" title="Life Education Trust">Life Education Trust</a> as their national project this year. Rural Women New Zealand have been an important part of our history, spanning back 28 years, and the challenges for children growing up today are certainly no less than in 1988,” says John O’Connell, Chief Executive of Life Education Trust (NZ). </p> 
<p>“We’re really looking forward to working together with Rural Women New Zealand and getting out to meet as many of you as possible, working together in partnership for the children of New Zealand.”</p> 
<p>------</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand request all branches and groups fundraise for the Life Education Trust and send their monies to National Office of Rural Women New Zealand. The total raised will be given to Life Education Trust to share among their community trusts around New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>]]></body>

        <title>Roar firearms and hunter safety</title>
        <date>Thursday, March 24, 2016</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/North_Tararua_Stag_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=204" width="204" style="border-style: solid;float: left;"> </p> 
<p>Autumn has arrived and as the climate cools&nbsp;hunters will start tracking into the bush for the roar.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand in collaboration with Council of Licenced Firearms Owners (COLFO) would like all hunters to take extra care this roar. Don’t forget to take with you a personal locator beacon (PLB) as they are an essential part of your safety kit if things go wrong. </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand President Wendy McGowan says, “More and more of our rural women are obtaining firearms licences and are out there hunting and gathering as well. Firearms licencing nationally is on the increase and our women are a part of the reason why.” </p> 
<p>“We want to see everyone home safely this roar, no more grieving families please. </p> 
<p>“Every year there are injuries or fatalities involving firearms and now is a good time for users to remind themselves of some of the basic safety rules,” advises McGowan.</p> 
<p>Council of Licenced Firearms Owners (COLFO) Chairman Paul Clark reminds hunters of their responsibilities towards safe handling and security of the firearms before, during and after their hunt. “A firearms licenced owner’s responsibility does not end at the taking of their game, it ends when the firearm has been safely and securely stored away.”</p> 
<p>COLFO are aware of the increase in firearms licences being issued to women. Clark suggests “It is well known that women generally learn handling and shooting skills quicker and are often consistent with this.” He goes on to add “The adrenaline rush that most males get while hunting during the roar appears to have less of an effect on most women hunters.” </p> 
<p>Clark and McGowan both agree, “Full freezers, healthy eating and happy households this roar is the ultimate goal.” <br> </p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>THE FIREARMS SAFETY CODE:&nbsp;</strong>Seven Basic Rules of Safe Firearms Handling <br> <br> </p> 
<p> 1. TREAT EVERY FIREARM AS LOADED</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Check every firearm yourself. <br> </li> 
 <li>Pass or accept only an open or unloaded firearm.&nbsp; <br> <br> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>2. ALWAYS POINT FIREARMS IN A SAFE DIRECTION</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Loaded or unloaded, always point the muzzle in a safe direction. <br> <br> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>3. LOAD A FIREARM ONLY WHEN READY TO FIRE</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Load the magazine only when you reach your shooting area<strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; ">.</strong> <br> </li> 
 <li>Load the chamber only when ready to shoot. <br> </li> 
 <li>Completely unload before leaving the shooting area.&nbsp; <br> <br> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>4. IDENTIFY YOUR TARGET BEYOND ALL DOUBT</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Movement, colour, sound and shape can all deceive you. <br> </li> 
 <li>Assume colour, shape, sound, and shape to be human until proven otherwise.&nbsp; <br> <br> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>5. CHECK YOUR FIRING ZONE</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>THINK! What may happen if you miss your target? What might you hit between you and the target or beyond? <br> </li> 
 <li>Do not fire when you know others are in your firing zone.&nbsp; <br> <br> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>6. STORE FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION SAFELY</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>When not in use, lock away the bolt, firearm and ammunition separately. <br> </li> 
 <li>Never leave firearms in a vehicle that is unattended.&nbsp; <br> <br> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>7. AVOID ALCOHOL AND DRUGS WHEN HANDLING FIREARMS</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Good judgement is the key to safe use of firearms. <br> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

        <title>Quad bike safety</title>
        <date>Thursday, April 07, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/quad_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=295</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/quad_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=295" style="border-style: solid; float: left;" width="295">Rural Women New Zealand members are proactive when it comes to farm safety, especially regarding quad bike safety. For us it goes much further than wearing helmets.</p> 
<p>If the quad bike is not maintained to a safe standard, the risk of injury or worse is increased, no matter how much training someone has had and that they are wearing the correct protective equipment.</p> 
<p>It is the responsibility of all involved in the business to ensure that a quad or any machinery is safe to use. Before use, do a quick walk around a machine for a basic check of your quad, car, bike or tractor. This action could prevent an incident and save a lifetime of pain and suffering for the rider, their family and community. </p> 
<p>For quads there is a useful check system TCLOC, which should be done regularly, preferably daily: <br> </p> 
<p>T Tyres, wheels, wheel nuts:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>-Are tyres at the correct pressure? Find out the correct pressure.</li> 
 <li>-Do the tyres have sufficient tread? Are they damaged?</li> 
 <li>-Are rims in good condition?</li> 
 <li>-Are wheel nuts tightened correctly?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>C Controls:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>-Do all control levers work e.g. 4WD/2WD, foot brakes and hand brakes?</li> 
 <li>-Do you know what all controls do and how to use them?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>L Lights and electrics:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>-Are all lights and electrics in working order?</li> 
 <li>-Do all the switches do what they are supposed to?</li> 
 <li>-Where are the battery and fuses on the machine?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>O Oils and liquids:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>-Check oil, brake fluid, fuel levels in the machine.</li> 
 <li>-Do you know how to check these? Is there sufficient fuel in the tank?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>C Chassis and suspension:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>-Check the chassis condition - no rust or damaged framework.</li> 
 <li>-Check for suspicious leaks. </li> 
 <li>-Wash the machine regularly so dirt and muck does not build up covering faults.</li> 
 <li>-Do you understand how the suspension system in the machine works? </li> 
</ul> 
<p>After a service it’s advisable to check that all work needed has been done. Provide a check list of your requirements to ensure the work is complete if necessary. </p> 
<p>Simple checks and maintenance ensure machinery runs more safely and efficiently and helps prevent accident and injury</p>

        <title>Health and Safety Legislation changes</title>
        <date>Friday, April 08, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/Gates-007_s.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=295</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Gates-007_s.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=295" style="border-style: solid; float: left;" width="295">Health and Safety legislation has changed as of 4 April 2016, make sure you are up-to-date with the new rules. </p> 
<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/CampaignProcess.aspx?A=Link&amp;VID=0&amp;KID=255916&amp;LID=1313830">Click here</a> to find out how the changes affect you and what you can do to keep yourself and people around you safe. <br> </p> 
<p>WorkSafe New Zealand have issued some guides to working more safely on-farm. In 2015 there were 122 sheep shearing-related injuries serious enough to require funding support from ACC. Leading injuries included back injuries, sprains, strains and muscular stress caused by prolonged bending. <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/CampaignProcess.aspx?A=Link&amp;VID=0&amp;KID=255916&amp;LID=1313759     ">Read more about safer farms</a>.</p> 
<p>Health and safety on farms is about looking after people – farm workers, contractors, farm visitors, yourself and your family.</p> 
<p>20 people were killed in workplace accidents on farms in 2013 – that's more than the number that died in forestry, construction and manufacturing combined – making farming one of the most dangerous occupations in New Zealand. These numbers represent peoples’ fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, sons or daughters, with the true impact of the deaths and the serious injuries carried by our farming communities and families.</p> 
<p>Each of these deaths, and many of the non-fatal injury incidents were preventable. The true cost of not taking health and safety seriously is far too high.</p>

<p>The Rural Women New Zealand and Access Scholarship is aimed at applicants who are working in the health field with rural connections, and wish to further their studies in health or disability studies. Preference will be given to applicants who are studying at post-graduate level.</p> 
<p>“Access is proud to support ongoing professional development for health professionals working in the rural community, and we are pleased to continue to offer the scholarship alongside Rural Women New Zealand,” says Simon Lipscombe, Chief Executive of Access.</p> 
<p>Wendy McGowan, National President of Rural Women New Zealand says the organisation is committed to offering the scholarship to rural health professionals. “We advocate for equity in health services in rural communities on a par with urban areas. That includes upskilling our health professionals to offer quality information and advice to rural patients,” says Wendy McGowan.</p> 
<p>Last year the scholarship was awarded to Heather Leong, a Community Registered Nurse based in Waikato. Heather intended to use the scholarship to fund her studies to complete an International Integrative Nurse Coach Certificate in the United States.</p> 
<p>Heather planned to apply the skills gained from her studies in her nursing work in the Waikato rural community.</p>

        <title>Duck hunting season</title>
        <date>Friday, May 06, 2016</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/hunter-hut-1352067.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=204" width="204" style="border-style: solid;float: left;"> </p> 
<p> </p>
<p>Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) in collaboration with the Council of Licenced Firearms Owners (COLFO) wish all duck hunters a safe and successful shoot this season.</p> 
<p>Duck hunting is a great opportunity to get the kids outdoors to teach safe firearms handling and behaviour around shotguns.</p> 
<p>“This is an excellent environment to teach our children multiple safe practices around firearms, including wearing warm clothing and correct protective gear such as earmuffs,” says Wendy McGowan, RWNZ President. “Shotguns fire at a decibel rating of 170dB which causes instant hearing loss to all those standing close by. Earmuffs or earplugs may eliminate permanent damage.”</p> 
<p>What we teach our children now, will set them up for a lifetime of enjoyment in this sport, if they can keep themselves and others safe."</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/CampaignProcess.aspx?A=Link&amp;VID=0&amp;KID=259652&amp;LID=1324236">According to Fish &amp; Game NZ</a>, there are more birds in some regions this year, and an extension to the season and increased bag limits in some areas. RWNZ and COLFO remind all firearms users to take heed of the seven basic principles of firearms safety this season. “Bring everyone home safely with a full bag of ducks."&nbsp;</p>

<p>NZ Landcare Trust's Board of Trustees will see a new face at the table, as Fiona Gower takes over from Liz Evans as the representative for Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
<p>NZ Landcare Trust CEO Dr Nick Edgar said, <em>"On behalf of Trust staff I'd like to welcome Fiona to the Board of Trustees. Fiona's extensive knowledge of rural issues and her understanding of community involvement will be a real asset."</em> </p> 
<p>Fiona is looking forward to the new role. <em>“With the growing importance, emphasis and pressure on freshwater in New Zealand, organisations such as NZ Landcare Trust will play an increasingly important role in achieving positive outcomes for our land and water resources, and I am looking forward to being a part of that journey,”</em> Fiona added.</p> 
<p>Fiona is currently the Vice President &amp; National Councillor for the Top of the North Island with Rural Women New Zealand and has served on their National Council since 2013.</p> 
<p>Fiona is a graduate of the Agri-Women's Development Trust Escalator programme and was a Kellogg's rural leadership scholar in 2009, and also holds a diploma in wool technology from Lincoln. Currently living on a farm at Port Waikato, Fiona works as a casual farm worker when not fulfilling her community commitments and running after her school aged children.</p> 
<p>Former Rural Women New Zealand representative Liz Evans has been an involved and proactive member of the Board. Dr Edgar said he would like to thank Liz for her considerable contribution during her tenure. <em>"Liz took an active interest in the Trust's activities and was very supportive of our practical 'grass roots' approach to sustainable land and water management."</em> </p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/gypsy day.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=194" width="194" style="border-style: solid; float:left">Many farmers, family, staff and animals move around the country to their next farms on 1st June, hence the term "Gypsy Day." </p> 
<p>This is the day when new dairy contacts come into action around the country. There may be huge shifts from Island to Island or just down the road. Stock trucks, furniture removal trucks, ute and trailer-loads of gear hit the road.</p> 
<p>These shifts can be stressful for all. Packing up houses and sheds, leaving friends behind and taking on new challenges. When young children are involved this can add to the stress, especially if farmers have no family close by or know no one in the community.</p> 
<p>This is where organisations such as RWNZ can come in with their social support networks, giving women and families an opportunity to meet new people. </p> 
<p>RWNZ encourages its members to welcome those moving into their areas by holding morning teas, community BBQ's or just popping in with some goodies for the new families. It is about letting them know what is in their community, and where they can go for schools, doctors and other services. </p>

        <title>Proposed changes to firearms' licensing impacts on rural communities</title>
        <date>Thursday, June 02, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/shotgun-2-1429440_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=198</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><strong><img src="/images/shotgun-2-1429440_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=198" width="198" style="border-style: solid; float:left"></strong>Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) is very concerned about the changes to firearms’ licensing, training and testing, being proposed by the Mountain Safety Council (MSC). The MSC executive has been announcing these changes in a series of road shows around the country. Volunteer instructors are being told their services are no longer required.</p> 
<p>The current MSC Firearms Safety Programme has about 480 volunteers with significant hunting and shooting experience. They are based in 150 locations in New Zealand. MSC propose to significantly reduce the number of trainers and the number of locations.</p> 
<p>The three models being considered are</p> 
<p>A. 40 part time paid instructors covering 50 locations, or</p> 
<p>B. 5 full time paid instructors covering 50 locations, or</p> 
<p>C. 15 Part time paid and 72 Volunteers covering 50 locations.</p> 
<p> <br>“The proposed changes will seriously impact rural communities,” says Fiona Gower, RWNZ Vice President.</p> 
<p>“Many rural people use firearms as a tool of the trade. The proposed reduction in firearms instructors and/or volunteers means that distances to travel to the nearest licensing centre will increase. There will also be less people available to do the educating, testing and related tasks, which means it is likely that it will take longer for these processes to happen.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ advocate for ‘rural proofing’ in policy development. This means taking into account the equity of access to services, as well as ease and cost of compliance for people living in rural areas.</p> 
<p>RWNZ believe that the proposed models have not considered the additional burden on the rural sector of the proposed changes to access to firearms education, safety training and licensing services.</p> 
<p>MSC volunteers have been delivering the Firearms Safety Programme for the past 30 years and its success can be measured by the steady decline in the number of unintentional shooting incidents, better practical training and advice, and monitoring of the behaviour and safety standards of fellow shooters.</p> 
<p>RWNZ say MSC should consult with representatives from the rural sector to assess the impacts on the rural community before they decide on making any changes.</p>

<p>Below are excerpts from Lady Janine Mateparae's speech at the Patronage Reception:</p> 
<p>"Jerry and I chose organisations we had an interest in, and those we thought were meaningful to New Zealanders. In my case, I have an interest in health and well-being, which I wanted to reflect in my patronages. I also wanted to continue the relationships forged by my predecessors. I’m happy that I was able to find a good balance between them.</p> 
<p>As Patron, I have appreciated the insights I have gained about your operations and your people. I have enjoyed opportunities to attend your events, your meetings or to host you here at Government House. It hasn’t been possible to attend everything I’ve been invited to. In those instances, I’ve really appreciated the updates you’ve sent me.</p> 
<p>I’ve also appreciated the support you and your organisations have given to me, particularly early on in our term. Your kindness was most welcoming and encouraging.</p> 
<p>One of the things that’s impressed me most is the dedication and commitment of the many volunteers who support your organisations. It’s the people I’ve met who have made being a Patron special for me.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand’s annual reports were a yearly highlight, and kept me up to date with what was happening. On my first event with them I was horrified to learn that I was on the same speaking card as the Prime Minister – no pressure!</p> 
<p>Once again, thank you all for your contribution, your service and the work you do. The opportunity to be part of your world over the last five years has been important for me in contributing to Jerry’s and my community leadership role. I wish you, your people and your organisations all the best in your future endeavours."</p> 
<p>Sir Jerry Mataparae and Lady Janine have now finished their term at Government House, we wish to thank Lady Janine for her patronage.</p>

        <title>CEDAW Report</title>
        <date>Wednesday, July 13, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/cedaw.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/cedaw.jpg" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">Minister for Women Louise Upston has submitted the Government’s <a href="http://women.govt.nz/documents/cedaw-eighth-periodic-report-government-new-zealand-2016">latest report to the United Nations</a> on New Zealand’s efforts to eliminate discrimination against women. </p> 
<p>New Zealand is required to periodically report on the country’s performance under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). This is the eighth report New Zealand has provided since ratifying the Convention in 1985.</p> 
<p>Ms Upston says the Government has made steady progress in improving outcomes for women and building on the fundamental guarantees provided by CEDAW.</p> 
<p>“The report responds to specific issues raised by the Committee, and outlines significant developments in recent years related to women’s civil, political and economic rights,” says Ms Upston.</p> 
<p>“New Zealand women do well on a number of economic indicators, with high participation and completion rates in tertiary education, and high workforce participation and employment rates,” says Ms Upston.</p> 
<p>“Government agencies have taken concerted action to reduce violence against women.”</p> 
<p>Ms Upston said the report had been extensively consulted on with the wider New Zealand public and the feedback received had been considered as part of the final report.</p> 
<p>“As an active player in the United Nations, we are committed to meeting our obligations under the human rights treaties that we are signed up to.</p> 
<p>“New Zealand has a strong human rights track record, but we welcome opportunities to identify and address areas where there is room for improvement,” says Ms Upston.</p> 
<p>New Zealand will appear before the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women to be examined on the report, after which the Committee issue concluding observations outlining any concerns and recommendations.</p>Rural Women New Zealand has been involved in consultation on the shadow CEDAW report.

        <title>Back to school: driving safely around school buses</title>
        <date>Friday, July 22, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/blog/School bus_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=200</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/School bus_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=200" width="200" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">As children return to school after the holidays, Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) reminds drivers to stick to the law and slow down to 20km/h when passing a stopped school bus. </p> 
<p>Rural children are especially vulnerable when drivers speed past school buses, and children have been involved in a number of serious and fatal crashes. The speed limit is 20km/h when passing school buses that are stopped to drop off or pick up children. The rule applies whichever direction you are travelling in.</p> 
<p>Drivers are also being reminded to slow down around schools and in communities. “Drivers need to pay attention to the speed limit of 20km/h when passing a bus that has stopped for children," says Wendy McGowan, National President of RWNZ.</p> 
<p>As advocates for safer rural roads, RWNZ has been supportive of trials of 20 km/h signs on school buses in Ashburton. NZTA southern regional director, Jim Harland says that a trial of 20km signs on school buses in Ashburton showed a reduction in the speed of traffic passing a school bus, which had stopped to let children on or off.</p> 
<p>However, he also remarked that "earlier trials of signs without the support of the community and police, indicated that the speed variation of traffic passing school buses may increase the risk rather than improving safety."</p> 
<p>RWNZ encourages the community to obey the speed limit and encourages families to get involved in teaching children road safety messages. Brake NZ, the road safety charity have travel tips for families on their website (www.brake.org.nz). Advice includes young children holding hands when crossing roads, and teaching children to “stop, think, look, listen and live” before crossing roads. Other tips include children wearing high visibility vests and planning a safe route to cross roads.</p>

        <title>Access Community Health and RWNZ Scholarship winners</title>
        <date>Monday, August 01, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/Jo Tiller and Felicity Lallier.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=250</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img src="/images/Jo Tiller and Felicity Lallier.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=250" width="250" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">For the first time in the history of the Access Community Health and Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) scholarship there are two recipients. 
<p>The standard of applications was very high and the review panel could not separate the top two applicants. Felicity Lallier from Horowhenua and Jo Tiller from Greymouth will each receive a $3,000 fund to help support their health-related post graduate studies. <br> </p> 
<p>For Jo Tiller, caring is very much in the genes. Her father was a consultant physician and her mother worked as a nursing sister, exposing Jo to the world of health care from an early age. Jo plays a crucial role at Greymouth hospital where, having specialised in post anaesthesia care and recovery, she will be consolidating all her skills through her Post Graduate Diploma in Health Sciences - Rural Nursing. </p> 
<p>“I'm very passionate about my nursing and consider it a gift to be able to help people recover. We help treat people from across the entire West Coast. Many people in our rural community have seasonal and outdoor livelihoods and often want their care and treatments catered around that. I am really inspired by the patient’s motivation and commitment to their role in the community.”</p> 
<p>Felicity Lallier entered the health profession as a paramedic fairly late in life. Originally from New Zealand, she trained in the United States where she saw many differences in the types of emergencies compared with her home in Horowhenua. “There were a lot a big trauma situations whereas, here with such a large population of older people, we see a lot of falls and wound care,” she says. “In the United States we had access to closer facilities unlike here where patients can be 45-60 minutes away from emergency care.”</p> 
<p>Felicity has a Paramedic Bachelor’s degree from Whitireia and is now studying for a Post Graduate Diploma in Health Science Paramedicine while working part time as an Intensive Care Paramedic with St John. Felicity's qualification and training will mean she will be able to provide an invaluable and extensive service to the rural community, consolidating a number of clinical skills including being able to use antibiotics and treating patients on the spot.</p> 
<p>Access Community Health Chief Executive, Simon Lipscombe, says both women reflect the importance of the services provided, by helping support people to remain independent in their communities and homes. “We were impressed by the passion they both showed for their rural areas and their desire to continue their studies. We recognised the great benefits this would bring to the rural communities they serve.”</p> 
<p>To ensure each recipient would receive $3000, Access Community Health and RWNZ contributed extra funds towards this year's scholarship. RWNZ’s Health Portfolio spokesperson Margaret Pittaway says “both women were outstanding in their commitment to their profession and very focused on using post-graduate health studies to improve care and treatment of patients in the rural community.”</p>

<p> This award has been secured by Rural Women New Zealand in a partnership with the New Zealand Guild of Agricultural Journalists and Communicators. <strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p>The award has been established to recognise the important contribution women make in the rural community, either through their role in the farming sector or to the general rural environment, in its broadest interpretation.</p> 
<p>In the past the award category has been very popular as it encourages journalists to report on the achievements of women living and working in rural communities. The award recipient will demonstrate excellent understanding of issues and effectively communicate women’s responses to farming, family and business challenges, in way which both inspires and informs readers.</p> 
<p>Entry details:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Entries must be of TWO articles /programmes based on the theme of “rural women making a difference”. This could be in the sense of community involvement, on farm or in another rural-based&nbsp;business or activity.</li> 
 <li>Any New Zealand-based journalist or communicator is eligible to enter the award. You can only put in one entry per person, unless part of another shared entry.</li> 
 <li>Entries must have been published, broadcast or delivered in the 12 months to August 31, 2016. Entries must not be advertising or advertorial. The Award can be made to a group or team. If a team wins the Award, it is to be shared between those named on the entry form.</li> 
 <li>The Award will be judged on the overall quality of writing or scripting, how interest is captured and complexity explained, and also on the choice and relevance of any supporting information. In particular, readers/listeners/viewers have to be informed, and develop an understanding of the contributions made by the woman / women in their particular field.</li> 
 <li>The judges will not consider aspects out of control of the entrants e.g. layout, headlines and other display problems. Entrants must however make clear on the entry form which aspects of the submission were beyond their control.</li>

        <title>RWNZ at the Law and Order Select Committee</title>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/shotgun-2-1429440_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=168" width="168" style="border-style: solid;float: left;"> “More resources for front line policing, targeting resources at criminal activities and not adding onerous burdens on law abiding rural firearms’ licence holders.” </p> 
<p>Rachael Dean, RWNZ’s National Finance Chair, spoke at the Law and Order Select Committee on the illegal possession of firearms, on Wednesday 17 August to voice the concerns of Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) members.</p> 
<p>The illegal possession of firearms is an issue of immense importance to RWNZ members, many of whom are responsible licensed firearm owners and live in communities where firearms are an essential and everyday part of rural life.</p> 
<p>“The ability to own a firearm in rural New Zealand is vital for farming purposes and for a range of other popular sporting and recreational pursuits including hunting, shooting and collecting,” said Rachael.</p> 
<p>RWNZ feel strongly that better police enforcement of existing licencing controls, along with increased frontline police would be more effective in dealing with the issues of illegal possession of firearms. RWNZ think that at present there is a serious shortage of police in rural areas and believe this should be viewed as a primary cause of firearm thefts in rural communities. The focus should be on improving community safety and on the prevention of organised and firearm-related crime.</p> 
<p>“New Zealand has a ratio of one constabulary police officer to every 515 people. Queensland which has a similar total population and rural-urban population split to New Zealand, has one to 423 people and would be a good ratio to aim for,” said Rachael.</p> 
<p>The Law and Order Select Committee are considering a number of proposals including the introduction of a database to monitor all new firearms,and microchipping new firearms</p> 
<p>RWNZ believe that in the case of microchipping, criminals would simply remove or damage the microchips. The main effect would be to redirect police resources away from front line policing, to developing a system that would increase costs to rural firearms’ owners, and is likely to be an ineffective barrier to firearm-related crime.</p>

        <title>Fire and Emergency New Zealand Bill</title>
        <date>Monday, September 05, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/fire-truck-1557044.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=185</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/fire-truck-1557044.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=185" width="185" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">RWNZ has appeared before the Government Administration Select Committee discussing the submission lodged expressing its strong support for the Fire and Emergency Bill. </p> 
<p>RWNZ Vice President Fiona Gower says, this Bill represents an important step towards modernization of the fire services, ensuring it remains a fit for purpose service going forward and one that is appropriately funded.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Rural fire brigades are doing an exceptional job in the community, but they are struggling to cope with increasing demands and face significant funding gaps in recruiting and training paid and unpaid workers to the service”. The reality today, is that rural fire services are called upon to perform a variety of services in the community, well beyond their traditional roles of ‘putting out fires’.</p> 
<p> In rural areas, the local fire brigade is often first on the scene to respond to traffic accidents and medical emergencies. They provide vital assistance in search and rescue efforts and in responding to severe weather events and natural disasters. RWNZ have high hopes that the additional government funding promised by this Bill and the unification of rural and urban fire services will go some distance towards addressing these issues.</p> 
<p>In their submission RWNZ, note two areas of the proposed Bill that they believe warrant further consideration by the Committee. Fiona Gower says, “We think that the role of the fire service in responding to adverse weather events and natural disasters should properly be recognized as a ‘core function’ under the Bill. This is a core role of the service in rural parts of New Zealand where events like the 2015 North Canterbury droughts and flooding are becoming an increasing and more frequent reality. It is important that the role that that fire services take in responding to such events is appropriately recognized and funded”. The submission also encourages the Committee to consider whether a general taxation model of funding, would be a fairer approach to the current model, which is based on insurance levies.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Submission on the review of the Telecommunications Act 2001</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 07, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/unplugged-1194941.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=213</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/unplugged-1194941.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=213" width="213" style="border-style:solid;float: left;">RWNZ has lodged a submission to the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) on its review of the Telecommunications Act.</p> 
<p>While RWNZ strongly support the need for a new regulatory approach to wholesale telecommunication prices, RWNZ Vice President Fiona Gower says that it is disappointing that the review does not address the issue of underinvestment in telecommunications. </p> 
<p>“We feel strongly that a key goal of the review should include bringing rural broadband speeds up to the same standard as urban speeds”. While considerable progress has been made through the Government’s Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI), the reality for rural and remote users is that the current state of the network remains poor. In addition, it is concerning that the Government is directly funding UFB deployment in urban areas but it is not actually putting any funding into rural areas as part of the RBI”. </p> 
<p>The RBI continues to be funded directly by the industry through the Telecommunications Development levy. </p> 
<p>Fiona Gower also states that the end-user impact of the proposed utility style pricing regulation remains unclear. “Primarily our members want internet and phone prices to remain affordable whilst also encouraging wholesale network operators to invest appropriately in improving rural infrastructure. We are concerned about how changes to wholesale prices will be treated by Retail Service Providers and reflected in retail prices”. </p> 
<p>MBIE's review also proposes exploring options for promoting competition in the mobile market. Fiona Gower says “Mobile coverage is seriously lacking in rural areas, despite the fact that these days it is considered a basic lifeline in emergency situations”.</p> 
<p>RWNZ’s submission encourages the Government to proceed with options that encourage greater infrastructure sharing and competition between mobile network operators. It also suggests additional government stimulus may be necessary to fund further investment by mobile network operations in the most uneconomic areas of the network. </p> 
<p>RWNZ have read the submission made by TUANZ, and as a member, lend their support to the TUANZ submission on the review of the Telecommunications Act.</p>

        <title>RWNZ Submission on the government health strategy for older adults</title>
        <date>Friday, September 09, 2016</date>
        <img>/mother-and-daughter-1439686-639x424.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=173</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/mother-and-daughter-1439686-639x424.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=173" width="173" style="border-style:solid;float: left;">RWNZ has lodged a submission on the Ministry of Health’s update of the Health of Older people strategy, urging the Government to give priority to the unique needs of older adults in rural areas.</p> 
<p>RWNZ Health spokesperson, Margaret Pittaway says, “The strategy sets out a worthy and aspirational set of goals for the health and wellbeing of older adults for the next ten years, yet it fails to give appropriate attention to the special and unique challenges of ageing in rural areas.”</p> 
<p>In its submission RWNZ highlight ongoing barriers to access to older adult health services in rural areas, along with health disparities affecting this population group. ”Implementation of the actions in this strategy must be given special priority in rural areas, in particular the goal of bringing health services closer to home deserves immediate attention in rural areas” says Margaret Pittaway.</p> 
<p>There remains a distinct lack of primary healthcare services in rural areas and geographical barriers of access. According to a survey of RWNZ members over 25% of those living in rural areas must travel over 30 minutes to access the closest GP. “There must be greater government investment in retaining and training a dedicated health workforce for rural populations, if the government is to achieve its goal of healthy ageing” says Margaret Pittaway.</p> 
<p>RWNZ‘s submission also highlights concerns around working conditions for those in the aged care sector and lack of support for the family and carers of older adults. “Unfortunately the government’s ‘Ageing in place’ strategy has had the consequence of placing the burden of care of older adults onto family members. More support must be made available for those supporting loved ones with acute health needs”.</p>

        <title>NZ Post announce changes to rural deliveries</title>
        <date>Wednesday, September 14, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/letterbox.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=173</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/letterbox.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=173" width="173" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">From November 1st, New Zealand Post is making changes to rural deliveries in some regions.</p> 
<p>Changes to the Deed of Understanding with the Government in 2013 allowed New Zealand Post to move to five day delivery in rural areas. From 1 November, more delivery runs will&nbsp;move from six to five days a week. Currently about 15% of rural customers are on five day delivery and this will increase to about 25%. <br> </p> 
<p>“We’ve been able to maintain a six day service for three quarters of our rural customers nationwide, but in some places, we don’t have enough items coming through the network for a six day service to be sustainable,” says Mark Stewart, Chief Operating Officer, Customer Service Delivery.</p> 
<p>“We’ll be notifying rural delivery customers affected by this change in the next few weeks,” says Mark Stewart. “They’ll continue to be able to send and receive parcels and letters Monday to Friday.”</p> 
<p>“We’re working hard to give our rural customers the best possible service at the same time as maintaining a commercially sound rural delivery network,” says Mark Stewart.</p> 
<p>“With the growth in online shopping, we’re also improving sending, delivering and tracking options for our rural customers,” says Mark Stewart. “The majority of rural contractors are now equipped with scanners, providing customers with better tracking information and the convenience of being able to know when parcels will arrive.”</p> 
<p>New Zealand Post is in the process of talking to its rural contractors about the changes. The runs affected are mainly in Southland and Otago as well as parts of Tasman, Nelson, the&nbsp;West Coast, North Canterbury, Hawke’s Bay and Gisborne.</p>

        <title>HP New Zealand Rural Schools Competition Open For Primary and Secondary Schools</title>
        <date>Friday, September 16, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/HP Image for Slider.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=190</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/HP Image for Slider.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=190" width="190" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">HP New Zealand (HP NZ) is asking rural students to share their vision of how they think they will learn in the future to be in the running to win a share of $26,000 worth of HP products and support.</p> 
<p>The HP Rural Schools Competition, in its third year, gives rural New Zealand primary schools - and for the first time this year - secondary schools, the chance to win HP technology and support best suited to the school’s needs. Entries are open now.</p> 
<p>HP New Zealand has partnered with Rural Women New Zealand, offering rural primary and secondary schools the chance to win HP products, including Sprout, a fully integrated 3D scanner, 3D object capture and editing desktop. The winning schools will also receive support from HP NZ experts to help them get the most out of their technology. </p> 
<p>HP Category Manager, Victoria Mahan, said she is looking forward to seeing the students’ and schools’ vision of how they think they will learn in the future and what they will be able to do with technology.<strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p>“We’ve opened up the competition to include secondary schools for the first time this year, so we’re really excited to see the visions of education in the future from a range of ages and rural schools.</p> 
<p>“All children in New Zealand need to be equipped to live, play and work in an online world. It’s not just about being engaged at school, but also preparing for the workforce of tomorrow. This competition is one way that HP can contribute,” added Mahan.</p> 
<p>“This is such a great competition and we’ve seen first-hand the benefits it’s delivered for previous winners. It’s a fantastic opportunity for rural schools to have the chance to tap into the expertise of a global technology company like HP,” said Fiona Gower, Vice President, Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
<p>Shaun Tepania, Principal of last year’s top prize winner, Whananaki School, said winning the HP Rural Schools competition has changed the level of engagement in the classroom. </p> 
<p>"This prize allowed us to provide devices that helped to support and engage the students’ learning, as well as giving our teachers opportunities to provide e-learning through their class programs. </p> 
<p>“This is an amazing opportunity for our school and the community. We would like to thank HP and Rural Women New Zealand for creating a competition that gives rural schools that extra support," added Tepania.</p> 
<p>Top prizes include the HP Sprout and schools can select items from the HP product range that best suit their school’s needs. This could include notebooks, desktops and printers, as well as support to set up the devices for the schools. </p>

        <title>Westpac bank confirms branch closures</title>
        <date>Monday, September 26, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/check-book-statement-1161213.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=226</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/check-book-statement-1161213.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=226" width="226" style="border-style: solid;float: left;"> </p> 
<p>Westpac Bank have confirmed the closure of 19 branches throughout New Zealand. A large number of these are based in rural centres. Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) is disappointed about these bank closures and the effect on the rural communities they serve.</p> 
<p>Westpac has stated that they will put in place some measures to reduce the impact of the closures. See below for the list of services available after the branches close.</p> 
<p>RWNZ acknowledges that banking has changed markedly over the past number of years and that perhaps rural towns do not offer a high level of commercial opportunities for banks.</p> 
<p>“However, there are still opportunities to explore provision of a mobile unit that can offer banking services, similar to mobile health truck units,” says Wendy McGowan, RWNZ’s National President. </p> 
<p>The solutions offered by Westpac Bank do not necessarily meet the needs of elderly people who do not have transport or are unwilling to do their banking online. </p> 
<p>Additionally RWNZ is concerned that rural residents living in isolated, remote areas will not have a reliable connection to the internet or mobile phone coverage and be unable to effectively access services online.</p> Branches affected by closure:&nbsp;

        <title>Back to school, look out for school children</title>
        <date>Friday, October 07, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/School-bus-Sign2_sized_New.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=205</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/School-bus-Sign2_sized_New.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=205" width="205" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">After two weeks of having children at home for the term break, it is time for them to head back to school for the final term of the year. Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) remind drivers that school buses are back on the roads and that sometimes unpredictable things happen around school buses when they are stopped.</p> 
<p>“It is very important in all communities, particularly in rural areas, that drivers adhere to the rule and slow down to 20km/h passing a stopped school bus, no matter which side of the road you are driving on,” says Wendy McGowan, National President of RWNZ. <br> </p> 
<p>“The roads in our rural communities are not always quiet roads and we need to be responsible for playing our part to make the roads safer for everyone who uses the roads, especially our children.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ also advocate for parents and caregivers to teach children about road safety when they are getting on and off the bus at the gate or at the designated point on the road. Accompany children to the bus stop and ensure that they understand what to do. Let friends and neighbours know that the buses are back on the roads and to watch out for children. </p>]]></body>

        <img>/images/logo.png?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=251</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/logo.png?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=251" width="251" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">Nadine Porter has won the Rural Women New Zealand Award for Journalism for 2016. Nadine's winning articles appeared in Ashburton's Guardian Farming and featured research on rural women and isolation and the role of social media.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An Otaki freelance journalist now working for RNZ News, Aaron Smale, took out the top award for agricultural journalists at the 2016 awards night for the New Zealand Guild of Agricultural Journalists and Communicators.</p> 
<p>Aaron won the supreme award, the Ministry for Primary Industries Rongo Award, which recognises excellence in agricultural journalism. He won the MPI Rongo Award for articles in NZ Geographic (Thick annd Thin) and North &amp; South magazine(Peak Milk).</p> 
<p>Runner-up in the MPI Rongo Award was Neal Wallace for two articles in the NZ Farmers Weekly.</p> 
<p>Aaron also won the <strong>AGMARDT Agribusiness Award</strong>, for the same two articles. This award recognises high quality information about and effective analysis of national, global and other agribusiness.</p> 
<p>All the awards for 2016 were announced at the Beef + Lamb NZ Awards Dinner on Friday night. A total of twelve awards were presented, eleven for journalism and one for photography. The key objectives of the awards are the encouragement and recognition of excellence in agriculturaljournalism.</p> 
<p>Other award winners on the night were:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Gerald Piddock, of Fairfax Media, who won the <strong>AgResearch Science Writers Award</strong>, established to enhance standards of science writing, especially about pastoral agriculture.</li> 
 <li>Gerald Piddock also won the <strong>Farm Business Writing Award</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong> which is sponsored by <strong>Balance AgriNutrients</strong>.</li> 
 <li>Susan Murrray, from RNZ’s Country Life programme, won the <strong>Federated Farmers Broadcast Journalism Award.</strong> She also won </li> 
</ul> 
<p>the <strong>Horticulture New Zealand Journalism Award. </strong>One of her entries in both of these two awards, Housing Versus Horticulture, won her second place earlier this year in the International Federation of Agricultural Journalists Broadcast Journalism Award, which attracted entries from journalists around the world.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Sonita Chandar received the <strong>DairyNZ Dairy Industry Award</strong> which recognises the ability to communicate the complexities of the dairy industry.</li> 
 <li>Fairfax Media’s Gerard Hutching won the <strong>Alliance Group Ltd Red Meat Industry Journalism Award</strong>. Entries into this award focus on all aspects of the red meat industry, from genetics, breeding, on-farm, processing, marketing, and all issues facing the red meat industry. </li> 
 <li>Neal Wallace, from Farmers Weekly, won the <strong>Beef + Lamb New Zealand News Award</strong>, which recognises excellence in hard news journalism, focusing on any aspect of the beef and sheep industry.</li> 
 <li>The <strong>Federated Farmers Rural Photography Award</strong> was won by MPI Rongo winner, Aaron Smale, for an image of high country mustering which appeared in NZ Geographic.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li>TheGuild’s own award – the <strong>Agricultural Journalism Encouragement Award</strong> – is designed to encourage and recognise excellence among journalists with three or less years reporting on agricultural issues. This year, it was won by Pat Deavoll, for articles which appeared in the Timaru Herald, NZ Farmer and the South Island Farmer.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Guild president, Ali Spencer thanked all the sponsors for their commitment to the Guild and assistance to the Guild in recognising excellence in agricultural journalism. </p> 
<p>Entry numbers were up on the 2015 awards, and for many of the judges, making the final decisions between the top entries proved difficult. She thanked all the judges, who spent countless hours reviewing the many entries.</p> 
<p>She congratulated all this year’s winners for the high standard of their entries.</p> 
<p>“We can all be reassured that New Zealand primary production and journalism and communication is in very good heart. It is spreading the knowledgeable word about farming practices and innovation in this important economic sector, not only to farming audiences, but also wider to the general population,” she said.</p>

        <title>Waikato University Quad Bike Survey</title>
        <date>Monday, November 07, 2016</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/quad_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=148" width="148" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">Rural Women New Zealand and Waikato University are working together to research how rural women view farm safety.</p> 
<p>There have been many studies undertaken, but none specifically for women.</p> 
<p>We encourage all women to participate in this online survey, which will then be followed up by some face-to-face interviews with women in the greater Waikato area, and the Bay of Plenty. </p> 
<p>Rural women's voices:</p> 
<p>This survey is part of a larger project that aims to look at rural safety through the eyes of rural women. We would like to establish the primary concerns of rural women in regard to farm safety. What hazards loom largest for you? We know that ATV's are problematic, as are water hazards such as ponds, streams and ditches. We cannot pretend to know the extent, severity and regularity of such problems, or of problems involving machinery, chemicals or even animals. Those with the best insights into the everyday experiences of rural women are the women themselves.</p> 
<p>We are beginning our research with this survey of as many rural women as possible. In order to get an idea of the most common problems, the most intractable problems, and those involving the highest risks, and those that produce the most frustration. It will therefore not cover just the risks, but barriers to overcoming risks. These might be practical matters, such as access to child care, or less tangible barriers such as culture and attitudes to safety. We will undertake this phase of the project by using an online survey tool, available through the link below.</p> 
<p>More detail about the research is available on the first page of the survey. You can click the link and if you are not happy with the survey questions, you can choose not to proceed. </p> 
<p>The survey will remain open for the next three weeks. Responses are due by 5pm Sunday, 27 November 2016. </p>

        <title>Media Release Land Transport Amendment Bill</title>
        <date>Monday, November 07, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/one-way-bridge-1215665.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/one-way-bridge-1215665.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182" width="182" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) has issued a submission expressing its support for the Government’s Land Transport Amendment Bill whilst also expressing concern about the recent spike in New Zealand’s road toll and current levels of policing.</p> 
<p>“On the whole the changes in the bill are directed towards improving road safety and we support them on that basis” says National President, Wendy McGowan.The Bill sets harsher penalties for offenders who flee the police and also makes it mandatory for high-alcohol offenders and repeat-drink and drivers to have breath testing alcohol devices installed in their cars. “However, we also note recent spikes in the road toll over the last three years, which we think do raise questions about the adequacy of current policing levels”. According to figures from the Ministry of Transport, the road toll in 2015 involved the highest number of fatalities on New Zealand’s roads since 2010. “We think the question of whether current policing levels are appropriate for road safety purposes should be examined as part of this Bill. The changes introduced in this Bill will only be effective with the right level of police enforcement ” says Wendy McGowan.</p> 
<p>In its submission, RWNZ also recommend that the Committee further examine the competition effects of new changes the Bill introduces to “small passenger services”. These changes will require the likes of Uber to be subject to the same licensing regime as taxi drivers, with the intention of creating a more level playing field. However, according to RWNZ’s submission the playing field in rural areas is already heavily skewed towards taxi drivers, which have a significant competitive hold on the market and the ability to charge extortionate prices. The lack of affordable taxi services in rural areas is a strong contributor to isolation in rural areas, particularly for vulnerable population groups like the elderly. “We want to make sure that these changes will encourage competition in the market, rather than imposing additional compliance costs on potential new players” says Wendy McGowan. </p>

 MINUTES
</div> 
<div>
 ITEM 1 – Welcome and introduction
</div> 
<div>
 The Chair welcomed the Forum’s members and introduced two new members, Rachael Dean from Rural Women NZ and Trent Smith from NZ Retail. Members were advised of safety procedures and evacuation protocol. The Chair stated that the forum would be conducted under the Chatham House Rules – members are free to use the information received during the course of the meeting, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speakers, may be revealed. The aim of the meeting is to open up lines of communication, and as a result, create a culture of trust.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 ITEM 2 – Action Points from last Meeting
</div> 
<div>
 1. Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill
</div> 
<div>
 This Bill is currently before the Select Committee, which is reviewing the Departmental Report. The proposed amendments enhance rangers’ ability to detect and investigate offences against the Wildlife Act. Police investigated whether a consequential amendment to the Arms Act was required so that rangers could seize firearms in the course of their duty under the Bill. The Department of Conservation’s view is that there is no need for a special provision in the Bill as section 73 of the Arms Act specifies that “any person who seizes any article, being a firearm, airgun, pistol, imitation firearm, restricted weapon, ammunition, or explosive, in the exercise of a power conferred on him by any Act may have possession of that article so long as he is acting in the exercise of that power and in connection with his official duties”. Police’s legal team also confirmed that this should cover rangers taking possession of firearms in the course of their duty.
</div> 
<div>
 2. Permit date recorded on import permits to be date of issue (not date of application)
</div> 
<div>
 Police reported that this has been actioned and will now apply to all future applications for import permits.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 3. Official Information Act Database
</div> 
<div>
 A Police action point is to record all OIA requests on firearm issues and the response to these on our website. This is a work in progress. Police will follow the example of other government agencies and redact the names of the requesters. It was noted that Police deals with far more official information requests than other agencies.
</div> 
<div>
 ITEM 3 – Cross-agency Firearms Working Group Update and Next Steps
</div> 
<div>
 The Working Group last met at the end of July and is working with Customs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), and the Department of Internal Affairs. Customs is reviewing internal processes and the Group is still following up on MFAT (processes between Police and MFAT) and the Department of Internal Affairs (leveraging the use of RealMe). Currently the Working Group is looking for Analysts to develop options. The Group will be looking for stakeholder input.
</div> 
<div>
 There was a presentation on the ‘Firearms Administration and Management’ project, where it was suggested that New Zealand’s firearms system is not making the best use of technology. Police is committed to ensuring that the community receives Better Public Services. Since New Zealand’s primary firearms legislation was introduced in 1983, areas of inefficiency have clearly emerged. Opportunities exist to make better use of modern technology, ensure consistency of service across the country, and improve information about firearms in New Zealand. It was theorised that if Police were able to make better use of technology, it will benefit both Police and the wider firearms community. It is envisaged that the Better Business Case framework will ensure clearer thinking and prevent failure in the future.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 The Firearms Business Case will combine the development of the:
</div> 
<div>
 •Strategic case
</div> 
<div>
 •Economic case
</div> 
<div>
 •Commercial case
</div> 
<div>
 •Financial case, and
</div> 
<div>
 •Management case.
</div> 
<div>
 Multiple government bodies will be involved, including Police, Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). As an example, the commercial case relates to procurement, so it will look to MBIE’s expertise, while the financial case would be consulted with Treasury. This consultation is crucial to ensuring the best understanding of ideas. Some members were wary that advice might not be sourced from people with the appropriate skill set, as they believed was the case with the Policing (Cost Recovery) Amendment Bill. One member indicated that the Bill gave a blank cheque in what could be charged, as it included terms and phrases such as ‘costs’, ‘indirect costs’ and ‘potential costs of services that are not to be provided directly to the person who pays the fee or charge’. The member indicated that these terms are very broad and give little scope to audit those being charged.
</div> 
<div>
 Police is currently consolidating the strategic case and has:
</div> 
<div>
 •Completed the Investment logic mapping workshops
</div> 
<div>
 •Visited Police Districts to hear from the Firearms team members who provide services; and
</div> 
<div>
 •Begun preparing the ground work for the economic case – working on options for early 2017 (not including legislation).
</div> 
<div>
 There will be consultation on the economic case, before it is signed off by a Deputy Commissioner. Some members suggested that the underlying direction of the project might overly rely on good
</div> 
<div>
 internet access and that this might be problematic for rural communities. The presenter suggested
</div> 
<div>
 that internet access is just one aspect to the approach. For this reason, one member proposed that rural communities should have the opportunity to ‘rural-proof’ any options by ensuring they can contribute to the policy making process.
</div> 
<div>
 One member queried how much revenue generated from firearm licence fees and endorsements came back to Police. Police advised that firearms licensing1 by Police is funded from a combination of Crown revenue and revenue obtained from fees for applications for firearms licences, dealers’ licences, and firearm licence endorsements. The revenue obtained from fees was $3,103,723 in
</div> 
<div>
 2013/14 and $4,226,946 in 2014/15. This covers less than half the cost of firearm licensing, which can be seen from the output expense statements for firearms licensing included in the Police Annual Reports which record that the actual amounts spent on this output were $8,609,000 in 2013/14 and
</div> 
<div>
 $10,283,000 in 2014/15. The budget allocation in each of those years, funded from Crown and third party revenue, was $9,576,000 and $11,676,000 respectively.
</div> 
<div>
 Police indicated that fees and costs are being further analysed as a part of the Firearms project (also accessible on http://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/firearms-community- advisory-forum-minutes-may-2016.pdf). One member indicated that given concerns around whether the basis for calculating the charges was fair and equitable, the basis for particular fees should be as transparent as possible. One major reason for this is that the firearms community believes that they receive mediocre service. Police confirmed that this is going to be looked at in the project. Any adjustment to the level of Police resources will depend upon greater understanding of the problem and the outcome of the project. Members expressed concern about the amount of time that this will take. On the subject of costs, one member expressed disappointment with the fee-setting process and the inclusion of overheads in the Policing (Cost Recovery) Amendment Bill and did not consider this to be the appropriate way to calculate fees.
</div> 
<div>
 ITEM 4 – Law and Order Committee Inquiry into illegal possession of firearms
</div> 
<div>
 The Law and Order Committee received 98 written submissions on the ‘Inquiry into the illegal possession of firearms’, including four late submissions. On 10, 17 and 24 August, submitters have been presenting oral submissions before the Committee. Police is currently preparing a Departmental Report based on the issues raised in the submissions. There is no clear indication of any recommendations that the Committee might be favouring, although common themes from the submissions include improving burglary resolution rates and noting the serial numbers of firearms in more cases. It is unclear when the committee will report back.
</div> 
<div>
 There are no major surprises from the submissions, although there is a fear being expressed by some submitters that members of the public have the ability to hack into Police’s database to find the names and details of firearms licence holders. Police continues to focus on maintaining safe and secure information to minimise the risk of successful hacking.
</div> 
<div>
 It is also important to note that it is not within the Committee’s remit to make recommendations about increasing Police numbers generally, or in rural communities. Members also expressed reservations about TradeMe’s submission which asked for access to Police’s national firearms licence register to electronically verify the details of firearms licence holders. Police explained that TradeMe had previously approached Police with a proposal to develop greater security around their firearm sales, and that if a database were developed, ultimately it would be available to commercial traders generally.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 A member also raised concerns about the current mail order system (as required in section 43A of the Arms Act) and its inefficiencies, particularly in rural communities. Firearms users and sellers may not necessarily have a mobile or email address, but the forms require these details to purchase
</div> 
<div>
 1 This output covers the processing of applications for firearms licences, the issuing of licences, the verification of compliance with endorsed licences, enforcement, and the revocation of firearms licences. It also covers the work to ensure people who licences have expired have lawfully disposed of any firearms they have possessed.
</div> 
<div>
 a firearm. The forms are also not very easy to use, and may need to be altered. Members also questioned general duty constables’ knowledge of firearms. Police acknowledged that the system could be more user friendly. One member was of the view that the mail order system works for the most part. Police commented that people should consider going to their Arms Officer. However, one member indicated that this may involve considerable travel and cost for rural communities. The list of Arms Officers can found at http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/firearms/firearms- licensing-contact-details.
</div> 
<div>
 One member read from a copy of an email sent to Wellington Police by a person intending to purchase online using the available form who outlined considerable difficulties in completing the process, although Police advised that the person’s issues have been resolved.
</div> 
<div>
 Action point:
</div> 
<div>
 -Police to do some tidying up of the mail order system to ensure it can work smoothly. This issue can be revisited at the next meeting. Police will try to notify the forum ahead of this time if there are any changes.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 ITEM 5 – Mountain Safety Council review
</div> 
<div>
 Police is not involved in the Mountain Safety Council’s (MSC) review and would prefer not to comment on it at this stage.
</div> 
<div>
 The MSC advised that it continues to review its programme, which includes engaging with relevant sector organisations that have a vested interested in firearms education. Its main focus remains on educating the firearms community and educating prospective firearm licence holders. A member expressed a desire for MSC to engage with the rural community, and the MSC suggested that they have already started doing so, having met Federated Farmers. The MSC have also run 22 workshops, where they have been able to engage with the firearm instructor network, many of whom have strong ties to rural communities.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 ITEM 6 – Update on Firearms legislation
</div> 
<div>
 There have been no changes since the previous forum. The Minister of Police is likely to discuss this with Police at some point, but this will not happen until the completion of the Select Committee’s
</div> 
<div>
 ‘inquiry into the illegal possession of firearms’. One possibility is that Police will produce a public discussion paper before any amendments proceed further, but this will depend on the Minister’s view. A possible legislative change that will proceed before other amendments to the Arms Act relates to introducing Firearm Prohibition Orders. A separate paper on this is being prepared for Government.
</div> 
<div>
 Police confirmed that it has not been proposing the formal registration of all firearms that might be in the system. In the past Police has not supported full registration of firearms if it was to try to capture the serial numbers of all firearms currently held by firearm licensees, partly because it would be very impractical to do so. Nevertheless, universal registration remains an idea, and will likely be considered by the Select Committee Inquiry. Recording more serial numbers than is currently the case, does have the potential to assist Police with matching more seized firearms with those lost through theft/burglaries.
</div> 
<div>
 Members expressed doubts about the idea of universal registration. There is a general fear, although one with no basis, that full registration will lead to confiscation of firearms. One member argued
</div> 
<div>
 that universal registration has not worked in any country and that Police databases are quite inaccurate anyway.
</div> 
<div>
 Police confirmed that there is no proposal being finalised with Government to reclassify all semi- automatic weapons as E category. Police is in the process of noting issues and coming up with possible options to present to the Minister.
</div> 
<div>
 If there were to be a public discussion paper it would be unusual to consult extensively prior to its release as that would be achieved through a widely available discussion paper that the public is consulted on, where it has a chance to present alternative options.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 ITEM 7 – Other Business
</div> 
<div>
 Members advised that the public wants more information on safes and storage requirements. The firearms community is frustrated with the requirements behind what constitutes a legitimate safe. Some expressed concerns that some safes were deemed legitimate 2-3 years ago, but now fail tests. Police, however, notes that there are no new storage requirements – the same criteria continue to apply. If security standards are not met, then the onus is on the owner to prove that the safe is secure, as approved by a certified engineer. Police must also be satisfied that the engineer inspecting the safe has sufficient knowledge to certify that the safe is adequate. If someone has an issue with a decision relating to a safe, they should discuss the issue with an Arms officer who will contact Police National Headquarters. People can always email Police National Headquarters as well
</div> 
<div>
 – Police will do its best to resolve the certification issue. Forum members should expect to hear
</div> 
<div>
 more on this in the next few weeks, although this could be longer if an appeals process needs to be ironed out. A checklist for firearm officers and dealers on safe specifications is being prepared in the shorter term.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<div>
 Action point:
</div> 
<div>
 Police to send out to the Forum the safe requirements checklist and to advise the Forum of the certification expectations when that exercise is completed.
</div> 
<div>
 There is general dissatisfaction with how long it takes to get firearm import permits. Often people are getting lawyers involved because it is a slow and onerous process. There is a sense that Police is very poorly resourced in this area. Police commented that it is in the process of resolving this issue, and that the waiting time has reduced significantly. The remaining permits that have lengthy waiting periods should be processed in the next couple of weeks.
</div> 
<div>
 Last year there were some issues with firearms licence renewals, with one person’s licence taking eight months to renew. This issue stemmed from staffing issues within Police and the peak in the applications for renewals. This has now been reduced to normal waiting times.
</div> 
<div>
 It was mentioned that there was a rumour that dealers’ fees were about to be substantially increased. Police advised that it is not possible for Police to unilaterally and arbitrarily raise fees associated with getting firearms or dealers’ licences – Police has to demonstrate to Government that increases are based on costs that are necessary and reasonable. It was noted that Police collected
</div> 
<div>
 $4,226,946 from fees for firearm licences, which accounted for approximately 50% of Police’s costs
</div> 
<div>
 in administering the Arms Act.
</div> 
<div>
 The next meeting is scheduled for 8 December 2016, 9:30am – 12:30pm.
</div> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Summary of the Firearms Community Advisory Forum Meeting: Thursday 18 August 2016</p> 
<div>
 1. THE MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING WERE CONFIRMED 
 <div>
  2. ACTION POINTS FROM LAST MEETING 
  <div>
   a) WILDLIFE (POWERS) AMENDMENT BILL: The Select Committee is currently considering this Bill. The proposed amendments enhance rangers’ ability to detect and investigate offences against the Wildlife Act. No consequential amendment to the Arms Act required. Rangers already have the ability to seize firearms in the course of their duty under the Wildlife Act and the current section 73 of the Arms Act covers the situation. 
   <div>
    b) PERMIT DATE RECORDED ON IMPORT PERMITS TO BE DATE OF ISSUE (NOT DATE OF APPLICATION): Police reported that this has been actioned and will now apply to all future applications for import permits.
   </div> 
   <div>
    c) OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT DATABASE: A Police action point is to record all OIA requests on firearm issues and the response to these on its website. Police will follow the example of other government agencies and redact the names of the requesters. It should be noted that Police deals with far more official information requests than other agencies. 
    <div>
     3. CROSS-AGENCY FIREARMS WORKING GROUP UPDATE AND NEXT STEPS: The Working Group is working with Customs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), and the Department of Internal Affairs. Customs is reviewing internal processes and the Group is still following up on MFAT and the Department of Internal Affairs. A bulletin was sent to Police staff on 16 August, and the Group seeks input from relevant stakeholders. 
     <div>
      The firearms system suffers from a number of clear inefficiencies. In theory, Police believes that better use of technology would benefit both Police and the wider firearms community. The Better Business Case framework will ensure clearer thinking and prevent failure in the future. There are five key sections that have been identified for development in the Firearms Business Case, including strategic, economic, commercial, financial and management cases. Multiple government bodies will be involved, including Police, Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). Police is currently consolidating the strategic case and has completed Investment Logic Mapping workshops, visited Districts to hear from the Firearms team members who provide services, and begun preparing the ground work for the economic case. There will be consultation on the strategic case before it is signed off by a Deputy Commissioner. 
      <div>
       Police outlined that $4,226,946 was collected in 2014/15 from firearm licence fees and endorsements, and indicated that fees and costs are being further analysed as a part of the Firearms project. This figure can also be found at http://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/firearms-community-advisory-forum-minutes-may-2016.pdf. Police confirmed that fee transparency is going to be looked at in the project. 
       <div>
        4. LAW AND ORDER COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARMS: On 10, 17 and 24 August, oral submissions on the ‘Inquiry into issues relating to the illegal possession of firearms’ were presented to the Law and Order Committee. Police is currently preparing a Departmental Report based on the issues raised in the written and oral submissions. Common themes from the submissions include improving burglary resolution rates and more frequently noting the serial numbers of firearms. It is unclear when the Committee will report back. A number of submitters fear that Police’s firearms database is vulnerable to being hacked. Police continues to focus on maintaining safe and secure information to minimise the risk of successful hacking. There have also been several comments about Police resourcing of firearm matters. Police acknowledged that the mail order system, required in section 43A of the Arms Act, could be more user friendly. Police will tidy up the mail order system to ensure that it will be run more smoothly. 
        <div>
         5. MOUNTAIN SAFETY COUNCIL REVIEW: MSC continues to review its programme, which includes engaging with partners and anybody that has a vested interested in firearms. Its main focus remains on educating the firearms community and educating prospective firearm licence holders. MSC has started consulting the rural community. Police is not involved in the review. 
         <div>
          6. UPDATE ON FIREARMS LEGISLATION: There have been no changes since the previous forum. The Minister of Police will probably discuss this with Police, but it is unlikely to happen until after the completion of the Select Committee’s ‘Inquiry into issues relating to the illegal possession of firearms’. Firearm Prohibition Orders may potentially proceed before other amendments to the Arms Act. A separate paper on this is being prepared for Government. Police confirmed that it has not been recommending a formal registration of all firearms that might be in the system. However, registration will probably be considered by the Select Committee. There is a general fear within the firearms community that full registration will lead to confiscation of firearms, but this has no basis. Recording more serial numbers may potentially assist Police with matching more seized firearms with those lost in burglaries. Police confirmed that there is no proposal being finalised with Government for the reclassification of all semi-automatic weapons. Police is in the process of noting issues and mooting possible options to present to the Minister.

Police, however, notes that there are no new storage requirements – the same criteria continue to apply.

            8. IMPORT PERMITS: There is general dissatisfaction with how long it takes to get firearm import permits. Often lawyers are getting involved because it is a slow and onerous process. Police commented that it is working to resolve this issue, and that the waiting time has reduced significantly. Remaining permits that have lengthy waiting periods should be processed in the next two weeks.
           </div> 
           <div>
            9. FIREARMS LICENCE RENEWALS: Last year there were some issues with firearm licence renewals, which stemmed from staffing issues within Police and having reached the peak of the ten year bell curve relating to the number of applications received. Delays have now been reduced to normal waiting times. 
            <div>
             10. DEALERS FEES: There have been rumours that dealers’ fees will be increased substantially. Police advised that it is not possible for them to unilaterally and arbitrarily raise fees associated with getting firearms or dealers’ licences.

        <title>Submission on the Education (Update) Amendment Bill</title>
        <date>Thursday, November 24, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/School-children_s.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=209</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/School-children_s.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=209" width="209" style="border-style: solid;float: left;"> Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) has issued a submission to the Government expressing concerns about the impact of the Education (Update) Amendment Bill for rural schools.</p> 
<p>The Bill proposes some significant changes to the Act, including allowing for the accreditation of private online charter schools. Under this proposal children as young as five years old will have the ability to elect to receive some or all of their education online. “The risk of online charter schools diverting both students and much needed government funding away from rural schools is something we are concerned about.” says former National President, Wendy McGowan. “Rural schools perform a vital role in their communities, yet many are struggling to cope with the unique challenges of providing education in isolated areas. The Government’s first priority should be in further supporting these schools, rather than seeking out alternative providers, which could challenge their viability” says Wendy McGowan. <br> </p> 
<p>In its submission RWNZ says that it doesn’t think that online schools are an acceptable substitute to traditional schools. “In general, we think most children benefit from being able to learn within a traditional school setting where they have the opportunity to socialize and interact with their peers. This is particularly true in rural communities where isolation is a major concern” says Wendy McGowan. “A further limiting factor of online schools is their reliance on a decent level of internet connectivity, something that is lacking in many remote parts of the country” says Wendy McGowan. RWNZ’s submission also outlines concerns that taking children out of the school environment could increase their vulnerability to abuse, neglect in the home and missing out on important primary health interventions, like vaccinations. Research from the United States showing that the academic performance of students at online charter schools is lagging behind those in traditional schools is also referenced in its submission.</p> 
<p>RWNZ’S submission also addresses the Bill’s proposal to shift Career Services into the Tertiary Education Commission. “We support the Government in wanting to improve career services to students, but we’re not sure how creating another unit within government will achieve this”, says Wendy McGowan. Changes which RWNZ do support include the introduction of a Statement of National Education and Learning Priorities and changes in the Bill to clarify government expectations around boards of trustees. “These changes will hopefully provide more certainty for schools, as well as consistency for students,” says Wendy McGowan.</p>

        <title>Submission on Tertiary education</title>
        <date>Tuesday, November 29, 2016</date>
        <img>/images/examination-web1.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=169</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/examination-web1.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=169" width="169" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">RWNZ has provided a submission to the Productivity Commission (the Commission) expressing concern about the equity impacts of its proposed reforms to the Tertiary education system.</p> 
<p>In its draft report ‘‘New models of tertiary education’ the Commission proposes a number of changes to the current funding and delivery of Tertiary education, including suggesting that the Government reintroduce interest on student loans and scrap University Entrance requirements. “On the whole, we are disappointed that the Commissions report approaches the issue of Tertiary education from a purely market based and individualistic perspective. The important public benefits of an inclusive and equitable tertiary education system appear to have been ignored ” says National President, Fiona Gower.</p> 
<p>RWNZ’s submission voices particularly strong opposition to the proposal to reintroduce interest on student loans stating that this would make tertiary education financially unachievable for many New Zealanders, particularly those from lower socio-economic groups. “An interest bearing scheme is also unfair for women, who may face higher repayments because they continue to earn less than men” says Fiona Gower.</p> 
<p>“Students from rural areas are also unfairly affected by this change. Many end up borrowing much more than those from urban areas, because they have to fund the costs of moving out of the family home to access Tertiary education”.</p> 
<p>In its submission RWNZ also voice concerns about the proposal for ‘Individual Student Education Accounts’, which the Commission recommends, would be capped at the equivalent of three years study. It points out that this could exclude less well off students from studying in more highly skilled areas like law and medicine, which involve longer periods of study. This proposal also suggests that students that get it wrong first time miss out on the opportunity for further government assistance for future study. RWNZ say its also thinks that Universal Entrance should continue to be based on National Secondary School Curriculum Standards.</p> 
<p>One positive aspect of the report is the recommendation that the Government open up the market to a wider range of education providers. In its submission RWNZ, suggest that allowing Agricultural degrees to be delivered by more industry-based providers could assist in overcoming the low number of students graduating with degrees in this field.</p>

        <title>Safety around school zones and school buses</title>
        <date>Friday, January 27, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/School-bus-Sign2_sized_New.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=207</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/School-bus-Sign2_sized_New.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=207" width="207" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) remind drivers that school buses are back on the roads, remember the 20km/h speed limit when passing a stopped school bus.</p> 
<p>“It is very important in all communities, particularly in rural areas, that drivers are aware of the rule and safe speed limit of 20km/h passing a stopped school bus,” says Fiona Gower, National President of RWNZ. <br> </p> 
<p>Additionally, the organisation NZ School Speeds is encouraging government to consider lowering speed limits to a maximum of 30km/h in school zones at peak times, to bring these in line with the 20km/h School Bus rule. "It is hoped that all political parties will agree to a speed restriction outside schools at peak times," says Lucinda Rees of NZ School Speeds. </p> 
<p>RWNZ also advocate for parents and caregivers to teach children about road safety when they are getting on and off the bus, at the gate or at the designated point on the road. Accompany children to the bus stop and ensure that they understand what to do. When picking up children, park on the same side of the road as the bus stop. Let friends and neighbours know that the buses are back on the roads and to watch out for children. </p>

        <title>Increase in police numbers will improve safety in rural communities</title>
        <date>Friday, February 03, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/police_crimestoppers.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=185</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/police_crimestoppers.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=185" width="185" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">The Government has announced an increase in police staffing. Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) welcomes the investment being made in policing, especially for rural and remote communities.</p> 
<p>“Safety for rural residents, property and stock is paramount in isolated farming areas. An increase in police numbers should lead to increased presence in rural areas that are struggling with crime, such as burglary, drugs and family violence. The new non-emergency phone number will also make it more efficient for residents to follow up non-urgent matters,” says RWNZ’s National President Fiona Gower. <br> </p> 
<p>RWNZ are represented on the Police and Rural Stakeholder’s Committee and the&nbsp;Police Firearms Community Advisory Forum.&nbsp;RWNZ has made several submissions to government regarding rural policing, safety and emergency services. In August last year, RWNZ presented a submission at the Law and Order Select Committee on illegal possession of firearms. The submission stated concerns about the shortage of police in rural areas, and the impact of organised and firearm-related crime on community safety.</p> 
<p>Police Commissioner Mike Bush has said the increase includes an “extra 880 new Police officers into frontline roles” in areas of “child protection, family violence and in rural communities.” In addition to more staff in communications centres, intelligence teams and in specialist roles. “These new roles will continue to ensure police have the right tools and resources to do their jobs and achieve the best possible outcome for victims,” says Mike Bush.</p> 
<p>The Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) has also responded positively to the announcement. Spokesperson Nicole McKee agrees, that the focus of policing in rural areas is especially welcome as COLFO has been advocating for more resourcing for police so they may combat crime where it will be more effective.</p> 
<p>“The Prime Minister’s backing of these key elements to effective policing will hopefully take the spotlight off the law-abiding firearms users and target criminals instead,” says Nicole McKee.</p>

        <title>Aftersocks™ NZ buy, wear &amp; share today</title>
        <date>Thursday, February 09, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/Aftersocks_web RGB.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=273</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Aftersocks_web RGB.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=273" width="273" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">The Aftersocks™ NZ campaign is up and running for the second time, building a community of fans and followers all wearing their support for the recent quake affected areas of New Zealand.</p> 
<p>To date over 21,000 pairs of socks have been sold to supporters worldwide since the initial launch in 2010 following the Christchurch earthquake.</p> 
<p>RWNZ are encouraging people to buy, wear and share their support on social media by tagging @aftersocksnz to inspire others to purchase a pair of New Zealand made merino socks.</p> 
<p>Proceeds from Aftersocks™ sales go to the RWNZ Adverse Events Relief Fund. Several grants have been distributed to individuals and groups in the areas surrounding Kaikōura, with the aim of raising community spirit. The small town of Ward, 20km north of Seddon the epicentre of the magnitude 7.8 quake, hosted a cricket match in January with assistance from the Fund. The sporting event and BBQ attracted 60 people including children, who were treated to a special visit from Mr Whippy.</p> 
<p>The RWNZ Hurunui District are hosting a comedy evening in February, featuring “Ethel and Bethel Bingo Babes” who are guaranteed to give the community a few laughs.</p> 
<p>RWNZ members from North Canterbury and the wider Marlborough region have also been visiting rural farmers and residents isolated by the quakes to distribute care packages.</p> 
<p>Rachel Bartrum's Kaikōura home and business, Lynton Downs Farm Homestay, was damaged by the quakes. The old house did a great job at staying up to let the Bartum family out safely, something Rachel says “we will be forever thankful for”. The quake exposed some relics with the falling chimney revealing several historic photos of the first Lynton Downs family.</p> 
<p>Rachel received a visit from a “wonderful” RWNZ member post-quake with a care package, “thank you so much, this will help us on our new journey of rebuilding on the farm.”</p> 
<p>The Adverse Events Relief Fund is available to individuals, communities and groups, with emphasis on rural women and children. Apply now,<a href="https://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/news-and-inspiration/apply-for-adverse-events-relief-fund" title="Click here"> click here for more information</a>.</p> 
<p>Buy a pair of Aftersocks™ today, visit <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz/shop">www.ruralwomen.org.nz/shop</a> to purchase. Share your @aftersocksnz on social media and wear your support proudly for those affected by the November 2016 earthquakes.</p>

        <title>NZ Post rural delivery changes</title>
        <date>Thursday, February 16, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/letterbox.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=151</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/letterbox.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=151" width="151" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">From 1 April, there will be no letter deliveries or mail pick-ups on Saturdays for rural customers who are currently on a six day delivery, says NZ Post Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart. Mail deliveries will continue as they are now, from Monday to Friday. </p> 
<p>Rural contractors will however continue to deliver parcels and subscription newspapers on Saturdays in areas where there is currently six day delivery.</p> 
<p>“Letter volumes continue to fall sharply, whereas the number of parcels and other products in our network is increasing,” says Mark Stewart.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand’s National President Fiona Gower says “The move to five-day delivery is in line with our expectations for rural delivery. However, we do have concerns that the delivery days do not decline further and are maintained at a minimum of five-day delivery.</p> 
<p>The five-day delivery allows for rural residents in remote locations to access postal services for mail, news and medication delivery. It also serves as a connection to their community.”</p>

        <title>RWNZ joins Firearms Safety Council of Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
        <date>Friday, February 17, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/shotgun-2-1429440_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=181</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/shotgun-2-1429440_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=181" width="181" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">The newly formed Firearms Safety Council of Aotearoa New Zealand includes shooting clubs, associations and affiliated organisations like Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) concerned about community safety with firearms. </p> 
<p>“Rural Women New Zealand have an authoritative rural voice and are pleased to be included on this Council” says Fiona Gower, National President of Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
<p>RWNZ are represented on the Firearms Community Advisory Forum and are also members of the Police and Rural Stakeholder’s Partnership.</p> 
<p>Rachael Dean, RWNZ’s Finance Chair and representative on the Firearms Safety Council, is looking forward to collaborating with other groups to reduce accidents involving firearms. “RWNZ want to work with associations to improve safety, and encourage firearms' owners to learn more about the safe use of firearms.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ has made several submissions to government regarding rural policing, safety and emergency services. In August last year, RWNZ presented a submission at the Law and Order Select Committee on illegal possession of firearms. The submission stated concerns about the shortage of police in rural areas, and the impact of organised and firearm-related crime on community safety.</p> 
<p>RWNZ has also expressed concerns about changes to firearms’ licensing, training and testing. RWNZ believed there needed to be further consultation with stakeholders and rural firearms’ owners.</p> 
<p>Interim Chair of the Firearms Safety Council, retired Police Inspector Mr Joe Green, says “one of the key objectives of the Council is to provide advice to government agencies and other organisations, such as the media, on firearms safety related matters.”</p> 
<p>The membership of the Firearms Safety Council includes the NZ Deerstalkers Association, Pistol NZ, NZ Shooting Federation, NZ Pig Hunters Association, Sporting Shooters Association of NZ, NZ Sporting Industry Association, Antique and Historical Arms Association, Federated Mountain Clubs, Target Shooting NZ, Firearms Safety Specialists NZ Ltd, NZ Black Powder Shooting Federation, NZ Service Rifle Association, Rural Women NZ and Safari Club International (NZ).</p>

        <title>RWNZ support the Domestic Violence - Victims' Protection Bill</title>
        <date>Thursday, March 02, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Woman on phone_cropped.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=184</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/Woman on phone_cropped.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=184" width="184" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">Green Party MP Jan Logie’s Domestic Violence - Victims’ Protection Bill is before Parliament, and RWNZ asks Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse and his fellow MPs to support the Bill. </p> 
<p>The Bill seeks to address harms experienced by victims, by focusing on how workplaces can be made a safer and more accommodating place for victims. It would extend leave provisions to include domestic violence leave, as when women leave a violent situation it can be very hard for them to manage court proceedings, counselling, housing and the needs of their children without extra leave. </p> 
<p>Work at a regular time and place can make work a target for the abuser, but with employer support through flexible working arrangements, that can be adjusted to support the employee. </p> 
<p>“RWNZ believe that the Bill will have an impact on people who are victims of domestic violence and help support them when they need to leave the relationship,” says Fiona Gower, RWNZ National President.</p> 
<p>“Rural women often have to travel long distances between home and work and it can be very difficult for them to move away from a violent relationship. </p> 
<p>“The services for helping victims of domestic violence are mostly located in urban areas. Enabling rural women to take time off work to access services, is a step toward helping them to move away from a violent home, and setting a plan in place to rebuild their lives.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ recently made a submission on the Government’s family violence law changes, in support of adding protection of animals to legislation. Violence to animals is often part of the package of abuse. Comments were also made about the lack of near-neighbours and isolation in general, also a woman’s support is often from friends and family of the perpetrator. </p> 
<p>RWNZ have worked closely with the Ministry of Social Development on the campaign: ‘It’s Not OK‘. RWNZ have held several workshops with the Sophie Elliott Foundation spreading the message of how to recognise healthy relationships, and how to assist someone who is not in a healthy relationship.</p>

        <title>RWNZ celebrates International Women’s Day</title>
        <date>Tuesday, March 07, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/blog/iwd.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=242</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<img src="/images/blog/iwd.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=242" width="242" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">On International (Working) Women’s Day, 8 March 2017, Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) would like to acknowledge the contribution of rural women to New Zealand’s communities and their pivotal role in primary industries and entrepreneurship. 
<p>For over 90 years RWNZ has been an integral part of the rural landscape. “RWNZ’s role is to support rural women through our organisation and help them grow. We have members from all walks of life and all industry sectors. Some members have incredible skills and knowledge which helps us innovate and find new ways to connect with the rural community,” says Fiona Gower, National President of RWNZ.</p> 
<p>“One of RWNZ’s greatest strengths is the branch network where members can meet others and learn something new. It is important that women can meet-face-to-face, especially if they are living in isolated areas. RWNZ branches host social outings, community events and regular upskilling workshops.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ is building partnerships with education organisations in the rural sector to assist members in developing their leadership skills and knowledge. Many members have progressed into leadership roles on local school boards, health committees, and district councils or become commercial company directors.</p> 
<p>The RWNZ Enterprising Rural Women Awards is a showcase for the success of women operating businesses in rural locations and contributing to their local economy and community. The competition has evolved over the years to promote entrepreneurship and encourage innovation in the use of technology in remote locations. Winners of the awards have included women lifestyle publishers, honey producers, native nursery operators, physiotherapists and adventure-tourism providers.</p> 
<p>Wellbeing and access to health services is a feature of RWNZ’s ongoing commitment to ensuring rural women and their families continue to thrive. Recently the focus has been managing the challenges of living in rural locations and dealing with adverse events such as drought, fires, earthquakes and floods.</p> 
<p>RWNZ are focused on building up community connections by hosting social activities such as Bingo nights and cricket matches which encourages people to socialise and have fun off-farm. It is also a good opportunity for people to connect with their neighbours and communities and talk about their experiences with others in similar situations.</p> 
<p>RWNZ also hold an annual Women Walk the World fundraising event in April. It brings together members and local communities to participate in a walk or social get-together. The proceeds are collected for the Associated Country Women of the World (ACWW). RWNZ is a member of ACCW which has a vision of an improved quality of life for women and communities worldwide.</p> 
<p>In late April the South Pacific Area Conference for ACWW will be held in New Plymouth, it will bring together rural women from around the Pacific region. Conference proceedings include the Women Walk the World event, business sessions and reports from international representatives. Delegates will hear about the progress of rural women around the world, development of their communities and improved health services, and opportunities for education. </p>

        <title>New Models of Tertiary Education Report</title>
        <date>Tuesday, March 21, 2017</date>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/examination-web1.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=169" style="border-style: solid;float: left;"> </p> 
<p> </p>
<div>
 In March 2017, the Productivity Commission released a report recommending a number of changes to the way the Government funds and delivers Tertiary Education in New Zealand. RWNZ asked members for their feedback on the Productivity Commission’s Report, to inform on our submission to the Commission.
</div> 
<div>
 It was disappointing to see that the otherwise excellent report of the Productivity Commission largely bypassed the rural sector, as it is a unique sector with its own challenges.
</div> 
<div>
 Without these issues being specifically highlighted in the report, it is unlikely they will be directly addressed in any actions taken by government as a result of the report. Not only are the challenges faced by rural people of all ages seeking tertiary education likely to not be improved, their ability to access tertiary education could be reduced due to unforeseen consequences of changes made, albeit with the best intentions, that have not been rural-proofed. It was largely evident from the outset, and in the wording of the Scope, that the rural sector was not identified as a “priority group.” Where the report provided graphical and statistical information, the categories were either gender based, age based or with Māori/Pasifika, and in some cases Asian, identified as unique categories. Again, it has been identified that the rural sector is not being recognised.
</div> 
<div>
 Also concerning, is the perception that in general access to affordable, fast, reliable broadband has been assumed to be available to all learners. If so, then those on the wrong side of the “digital divide” will be further disadvantaged. The 527-page report from the Commission focused heavily on the way education is funded and the constraints and barriers resulting from that. The
</div> 
<div>
 benefits of access to quality tertiary education and the wide range of courses, included ACE funded courses, which categorised tertiary education, were also well covered in the report.
</div> 
<div> 
 <br>RWNZ’s submission with respect to the low number of students graduating with degrees in agricultural based subjects and the mismatch with the demand for skilled workers in primary production,
</div> 
<div>
 was also commented on in the report. The recommendations generally were ones that should have a positive impact on access to education, although how much, if at all, the rural sector would
</div> 
<div>
 benefit is unknown. This information needs to be specially addressed. In conclusion, RWNZ welcomes the report, and believes some very sensible recommendations were made. It is hoped that some of the proposals that are being considered will first be rural proofed so that impact can be measured. RWNZ would be happy to input into this process.
</div> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Productivity Commission report is here:&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.productivity.govt.nz/inquiry-content/2683?stage=4">New models of tertiary education</a> </em>– the final report on the Commission’s tertiary education inquiry.</p> 
<p><b>Background:&nbsp;</b> </p> 
<p>In November 2015, the Government asked the Productivity Commission to examine how well New Zealand’s tertiary education system is set up to respond to, and take advantage of, trends in technology, internationalisation, demographics, tuition costs and demand for skills. We were also asked to identify potential barriers to innovation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Commission’s report and its package of recommendations seek to give providers the scope to innovate in the delivery of tertiary education, and incentives to do so. <br>Key recommendations include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>better quality control and self-accreditation for strong performers;</li> 
 <li>strengthening the role of student demand in allocating funding to providers;</li> 
 <li>making it easier for students to transfer between courses;</li> 
 <li>abolishing University Entrance;</li> 
 <li>better careers education for young people;</li> 
 <li>enabling tertiary institutions to own and control their assets;</li> 
 <li>making it easier for new providers to enter the system; and</li> 
 <li>facilitating more and faster innovation by tertiary education providers.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand published a submission for the Commission to consider in November 2016. <a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=222846" title="New models of tertiary education ">Click here to download the Submission</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></body>

        <title>Aftersocks™ boosts support for rural communities</title>
        <date>Tuesday, April 11, 2017</date>
        <img>/Aftersocks-large.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=189</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/Aftersocks-large.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=189" width="189" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">The Aftersocks™ NZ campaign has been gearing up over the last few months to become a permanent sub brand of Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) as our rural community continues to endure natural disasters and adverse events. </p> 
<p>This award-winning philanthropic initiative assists affected individuals, community groups and organisations in rural areas, with a grant, following disruptive environmental events.</p> 
<p>Over 21,000 pairs of New Zealand made merino socks have been sold, with proceeds contributing over $130,000 into communities since 2010. The recent Kaikōura earthquakes heightened the need to continue this support and include adverse events that have since followed; fire, floods and drought.</p> 
<p>To support this campaign, RWNZ have launched a website <a href="http://www.aftersocks.nz/">www.aftersocks.nz</a>, where you can Buy, Wear and Share your support with others. You can also apply to the Adverse Events Relief Fund for financial support, through this website. Grants to $1,000, can be approved for a wide range of needs, to those affected in the rural sector.</p> 
<p>RWNZ National President, Fiona Gower, is encouraging members to join the campaign on social media, “wear and share your support by uploading a photo and tagging the @aftersocksnz Facebook page. We want to see you wearing your pair of Aftersocks™ in support of affected rural communities”. The campaign aims to attract support for the fund, to then distribute back into those rural communities most in need.</p> 
<p>The Aftersocks™ NZ campaign promotes New Zealand supporting New Zealand made, supporting New Zealanders. The rural sector is a valuable industry, and what better way to continue to support this, than producing a product from merino wool. RWNZ has teamed up with The New Zealand Sock Company in Ashburton to produce Aftersocks™. This relationship now spans 6 years, with Sales Manager Jared Moore seeing it as “a privilege to work alongside Rural Women New Zealand, they are proactive, think outside the square, and they are doing great things in the wider community”.</p> 
<p>Due to the rise of production costs, there has been an increase in the price of Aftersocks™ from $20.00 - $23.00 including GST. </p> 
<p>RWNZ would like to encourage anyone who requires assistance following disruptive environmental events, to visit <a href="http://www.aftersocks.nz/">www.aftersocks.nz</a> and apply for the Adverse Events Relief Fund. If you, your Group, Provincial, or Branch would like to make a donation to the fund, please make your deposits into the RWNZ account, details listed below. Alternatively, if you would like to speak to us directly please call the RWNZ National Office on 0800 256 467 during normal office hours.</p>

        <title>RWNZ responds to the Law and Order Select Committee report on firearms</title>
        <date>Thursday, April 13, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/shotgun-2-1429440_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/shotgun-2-1429440_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182" width="182" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">The report of the Law and Order Select Committee into the illegal possession of firearms in New Zealand has missed the target says RWNZ.</p> 
<p>The report has largely disregarded the purpose for which it was set up (criminal use of firearms), along with the vast majority of the submissions and quality research.</p> 
<p>Earlier this year the Prime Minister, Bill English announced the Safer Communities package which will result in additional police, an announcement welcomed by RWNZ. Also welcomed by RWNZ was yesterday’s announcement of an extra 20 police stations around the country being ramped up to a 24/7 police presence over the next four years. It is hoped that these additional resources will benefit communities.</p> 
<p>Rachael Dean, RWNZ National Finance Chair says, “it is extremely disappointing that measures focusing on criminals have been largely ignored by the Select Committee but a law abiding shotgun or 22 owner can have their premises entered by Police without notice, and without a shred of evidence that the person has ever committed, or planned to commit a crime. However, the ability for the Police to do this is a recommendation of the Select Committee.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ believes that by continuing the focus on non-criminals, the Select Committee recommends a range of changes that will add to the cost and paperwork of licensed firearms owners. None of the recommendations are costed but it should be noted that expensive measures targeting non-criminals reduce Police budgets for other more pressing matters - such as increased police resources in rural areas.</p> 
<p>“Changes such as needing a permit to procure for the sale or transfer of all firearms means four trips to an already under-resourced police station to be able to borrow a neighbour’s or fellow rifle club member's .22 or shotgun,” says Rachael Dean.</p> 
<p>“Clearly the Select Committee believe rural people have nothing better to do then spend their days, at considerable cost, traveling on hilly, windy, gravel roads to carry out simple transactions. I doubt if the criminals using the sawn-off shot-guns referred to in the report will be bothering with permits to procure.”</p> 
<p>Other recommendations focus on having dealers keep records of all ammunition sold. "Aside from creating thousands of business records and adding to dealers costs, costs which be passed onto shooters, all this will achieve is a record of dealers selling ammunition to licence holders. There is no logical reason why this would prevent criminals having access to firearms," says Rachael Dean.</p> 
<p>RWNZ asserts that not only does the report largely ignore criminal use of firearms but also treats law-abiding people as criminals.</p> 
<p>"Where there is a focus on criminals is via suggestions that would legislate criminals into existence. As would be the case if for example, all the .22 calibre semi-automatic rifle, and semi auto shotgun owners suddenly found they now owned an “E” category firearm instead of an “A” category," says Rachael Dean.</p> 
<p>RWNZ suggests the Select Committee abandons the imposition of onerous, expensive, ineffective compliance on the law-abiding. RWNZ also suggests the Select Committee turn their thinking to their stated purpose and take an evidence-based approach to focusing on criminals also on criminal activities that are known to be associated with firearms, such as drugs.</p>

        <title>RWNZ proud sponsors of Number 1 Stand Documentary</title>
        <date>Friday, April 21, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/30 catherines semi 4.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<span><img src="/images/30 catherines semi 4.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=182" style="border-style: solid;float: left;" width="182">RWNZ is the Premier Sponsor for Number 1 stand; a film about five women in a unique workplace, the shearing shed.</span> 
<p>The shearing sports film investigates what drives women shearers to sacrifice so much personally and professionally to follow their dream to win The Golden Shears. The filmmakers follow five characters as they chase sporting glory, and delve deeper into New Zealand's most unconventional national sport.</p> 
<p>In New Zealand shearing competitions there is no specific women's competition. The women compete with the men, which demonstrates that the women competitors are achieving incredible accolades in a traditionally male-dominated sport.</p> 
<p>RWNZ will host the film premiere at the Golden Shears event in Masterton in 2018.</p> 
<p>“RWNZ is delighted to support this documentary as we believe it will showcase the hard-working women who dedicate their skills to shearing and wool handling,” says Fiona Gower, RWNZ National President.</p> 
<p>“For over 90 years RWNZ has been part of the rural landscape and historically many of our members were based on sheep farms or involved in wool production. We hope the story-telling will provide insight into New Zealand’s successful wool industry, and inspire current and future women shearers.”</p> 
<p>The rural landscape is changing and women are at the forefront of these changes with our documentary following some of these new pioneers, says Jack Nicol, documentary filmmaker.</p> 
<p>“We are immensely proud to be working with Rural Women New Zealand on this wonderful film. It feels like a natural partnership as the organisation represents the type of women we are following in our film – strong, resourceful, independent country women.”</p> 
<p>The five women featured include:</p> 
<p>Hazel Wood: junior shearer and dairy farmer based in Ruawai. <br> Catherine Mullooly: senior shearer working in Piopio and Australia. <br> Pagan Karauria: senior shearer and open wool handler, based in Alexandra. <br> Emily Welch: open level shearer and a shearing contractor and current world record holder for shearing 648 sheep in a day.</p> 
<p>Jill Angus Burney: open level shearer and barrister based in Masterton, and former world record holder. Emily broke Jill’s record.</p>

        <title>Safety first for duck shooting season</title>
        <date>Friday, May 05, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/hunter-hut-1352067.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=188</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/hunter-hut-1352067.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=188" width="188" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">Duck shooting season opened on Saturday 6 May and Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) wishes all duck hunters a safe and successful shoot this season.</p> 
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">Duck shooting season is an opportunity to get outdoors and catch up with fellow hunters. To avoid injuries or fatalities RWNZ reminds shooters to be aware of their responsibilities towards safe handling and security of the firearms before, during and after the shoot.</p> 
<p>“We want to see everyone home safely this season and that includes educating children on being safe around firearms,” says Fiona Gower, RWNZ National President.</p> 
<p>"Safety also includes wearing warm clothing and correct protective gear such as earmuffs. Shotguns fire at a decibel rating of 170dB which causes instant hearing loss to all those standing close by. Earmuffs or earplugs may eliminate permanent damage.”</p> 
<p>The seven rules of the Firearms Safety Code should always be observed to ensure hunters handle firearms safely, and keep themselves and others from harm.</p> 
<p>The regulations for game bird shooting may have changed since last season. RWNZ recommends duck shooters check with the Department of Conservation, Fish and Game New Zealand and private landowners to confirm legal game bird hunting areas and game restrictions for that region.</p> 
<p><strong>THE FIREARMS SAFETY CODE:</strong> </p> 
<p>1. <strong>Treat every firearm as loaded</strong> </p> 
<p>Check every firearm yourself.</p> 
<p>Pass or accept only an open or unloaded firearm.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Always point firearms in a safe direction</strong> </p> 
<p>Loaded or unloaded, always point the muzzle in a safe direction.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Load a firearm only when ready to use</strong> </p> 
<p>Load the magazine only when you reach your shooting area.</p> 
<p>Load the chamber only when ready to shoot.</p> 
<p>Completely unload before leaving the shooting area.</p> 
<p>4. <strong>Identify your target beyond all doubt</strong> </p> 
<p>Movement, colour, sound and shape can all deceive you.</p> 
<p>Assume colour, shape, sound, and shape to be human until proven otherwise.</p> 
<p>5. <strong>Check your firing zone</strong> </p> 
<p>THINK! What may happen if you miss your target? What might you hit between you and the target or beyond?</p> 
<p>Do not fire when you know others are in your firing zone.</p> 
<p>6. <strong>Store firearms and ammunition safely</strong> </p> 
<p>When not in use, lock away the bolt, firearm and ammunition separately.</p> 
<p>Never leave firearms in a vehicle that is unattended.</p> 
<p>7. <strong>Avoid alcohol and drugs when handling firearms</strong> </p> 
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">Good judgement is the key to safe use of firearms.</p>]]></body>

        <title>Slow down for Road Safety Week 2017</title>
        <date>Monday, May 08, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/20 roundel.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=136</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/20 roundel.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=136" width="136" style="border-style: solid;float: left;">Communities across New Zealand will be calling on drivers to #SlowDown as part of UN Global Road Safety Week 2017 (8-14 May), to help save lives on NZ roads.</p> 
<p>One in three fatal crashes in New Zealand involves someone driving too fast [1]. <br> </p> 
<p>A survey conducted by Brake, the road safety charity shows 78% of people are worried about being hit when out walking or cycling in their area, and 60% say they worry about fast traffic in their community [2].</p> 
<p>To mark Road Safety Week, Brake, the road safety charity, Safekids Aotearoa, Ministry of Transport, NZ Police, NZ Transport Agency, Auckland Transport, the Yellow Ribbon Road Safety Alliance, Rural Women New Zealand and other road safety organisations are calling on everyone to pledge to #SlowDown, in line with the UN theme for the Week. They will particularly be reminding drivers to keep well below speed limits around schools and in communities, and to remember the 20km/h limit for passing a school bus. Road Safety Week is kindly sponsored by QBE Insurance. </p> 
<p>Across New Zealand more than 700 schools, kindergartens, companies and communities are getting involved in the Week by holding a #SlowDown event, or other awareness-raising activity to get the message across about the horror of road crashes and the part we can all play in making communities safer. <em>(See details below of how to find out what’s happening in your area.)</em> </p> 
<p>New Zealand’s road safety strategy, <em>Safer Journeys,</em> includes safe speeds as one of the four pillars, and Brake will be highlighting the difference that even a small increase in speed can make to the outcome of a crash.</p> 
<p>Brake and Safekids Aotearoa are teaming up with Dr Michelle Dickinson (aka Nanogirl), Engineer at the University of Auckland and students from Meadowbank School in a video explaining the science of speed, reaction times and stopping distances. <em>(The video will be released on Monday 8 May, with a link available in an updated version of this release.)</em> </p> 
<p>Individuals and organisations will be using the <a href="http://brake.org.nz/assets/docs/Road_Safety_Week/RSW-signboard-no-text-A3.pdf">official Road Safety Week signboard</a> to make their pledge to #SlowDown and share on social media. School children around the country will be making posters to be displayed outside their school, or creating banners and going on a walk in their community reminding drivers to #SlowDown and look out for kids. </p> 
<p>The Yellow Ribbon Road Safety Alliance, a group of organisations committed to raising awareness of road trauma in New Zealand, is promoting use of the colour yellow to highlight road safety and show a personal commitment to safer roads, by distributing yellow ribbons and reaching out to government and businesses to light buildings in yellow during Road Safety Week.</p> 
<p>This is the sixth <a href="http://www.roadsafetyweek.org.nz/">Road Safety Week New Zealand</a> coordinated by Brake in collaboration with our partners, and the fourth <a href="http://www.unroadsafetyweek.org/">UN Global Road Safety Week</a>. Figures from the Ministry of Transport 2015 (the latest available) show that: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Speeding was a contributing factor in 32% of road deaths, with 101 people killed in speed-related crashes [3].</li> 
 <li>More than half those deaths were children and young people (5 children aged 0-14 and 49 young people aged 15-19) [4]. </li> 
 <li>Speeding was a contributing factor in 410 (21%) serious injury crashes, resulting in 496 seriously injured people [5]. </li> 
 <li>The total social cost of crashes involving drivers speeding was about $940 million, approximately 25% of the social cost for all injury crashes that year [6].</li> 
 <li>Speeding was a contributing factor in 34% of urban fatal crashes and 30% of open road fatal crashes between 2013-2015 [7].</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Speeding around schools is particularly dangerous as it puts children, who are unable to effectively judge vehicle speeds, in danger [8]. Police enforcement figures show the number of speeding offences near schools:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>In 2016, there were over 6,300 officer issued speed notices, and almost 75,000 speed camera notices for speed offences near schools. They accounted for 9.3% of all speed notices in 2016 [9].</li> 
</ul>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Caroline Perry, Brake’s NZ director, said: </strong>"When drivers use roads without care for others the consequences can be tragic and horrific – people killed and badly injured, lives ruined forever, because of a moment of inattention, impatience or a bad decision. At Brake we witness the suffering that results, through our work supporting people affected by road death and injury. Speed is a factor in all crashes. Whilst it might not have caused the crash, it will help determine the outcome. Even small increases in speed can mean the difference between life and death. That's why, this Road Safety Week, we’re asking drivers to pledge to #SlowDown for someone. Whether it’s your family, friends, community, or yourself, reduce your speed and help make our roads safer."</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Dr Mike Shepherd, Director of Starship Child Health - Medical and Community and Starship Safekids Aotearoa spokesperson, said: </strong>“Every year 22 children are killed, and 294 are hospitalised with serious injuries because of a road traffic crash in New Zealand. Speed is at the core of this child injury epidemic that is affecting communities and families across NZ and around the world. A concerted effort between the Government, organisations and communities is needed to stop our children from dying in NZ roads due to speed. Safekids and the World Health Organisation advocate for simple steps to manage speed: introducing more traffic calming features such as speed bumps, traffic signs, road markings and low-speed zones; establishing and enforcing lower speed limits, especially in school zones; install technologies in vehicles such as automatic emergency breaking (AEB); and most important of all, make drivers realise that speed kills.”</p> 
<p><strong>Harry Wilson, Director safety and environment, NZ Transport Agency said:</strong> “Everyone makes mistakes when driving, but a simple mistake doesn’t need to result in loss of life or limb. The faster you drive, the more likely you are to crash, and speed affects the outcome of every crash. Road Safety Week is a timely reminder for all of us to slow down and keep safe on the roads.”</p> 
<p><strong>Superintendent Steve Greally, National Road Policing Manager, NZ Police said:</strong> “We are all human, so mistakes on the road are going to happen. Sure – most of the time when we drive nothing happens, but how well prepared are we if something does? While you might not be at fault, the speed you choose to drive at determines the outcome of any crash.Safe speeds are essential for this reason, you can’t control the behaviour of other road users but you can control your own.As a safe driver, you’ll have to look out for changes in traffic, road and weather conditions, and reduce your speed accordingly. Also remember to look out for our vulnerable road users, like cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists. Increased speed, regardless of vehicle type, puts vulnerable road users at greater risk. For them, even a small reduction in vehicle speed could save their life.”</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Maria Lovelock, Programme Manager of Road Safety Education (RSE) and member of the Yellow Ribbon Road Safety Alliance said:</strong> “The Alliance believes that together we can all make a difference and change our road safety culture across New Zealand. 328 lives were lost last year as we got to our jobs, travel and families. The Yellow Ribbon symbolises getting home safely. As a society we need to change our mindsets about accepting a toll for using our roads and all pull together to drive more carefully and socially. We would like to encourage all New Zealanders to wear yellow this week in support of this and take a moment to think about one situation while driving where you could pledge to slow down.”</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) National President, Fiona Gower said:</strong><strong> “With school buses back on the roads, we’re reminding drivers to obey the 20km/h speed limit. It is very important in all communities, particularly in rural areas, that drivers are aware of the speed rule and drive at a safe speed limit of 20km/h when passing a stopped school bus.”</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Kathryn King, Walking Cycling and Safety Manager at Auckland Transport said:</strong> “Auckland Transport is supporting Brake with Road Safety Week by encouraging schools to get involved. Our team are looking forward to assisting schools with their road safety activities during the week.”</p> 
<p><strong>Bill Donovan, General Manager – New Zealand Operations at QBE Insurance said:</strong> “At QBE, we firmly believe we have a responsibility to be a good corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate. This is one of the reasons that we’ve supported Brake and Road Safety Week for six years. It’s an initiative to encourage commitment - both personal and corporate - to road safety, and we are very pleased to be part of this community initiative.”</p>

<p><strong><u>Facts on speed</u></strong> </p> 
<p>Driving is the most dangerous thing most of us do on a regular basis: you're operating a potentially dangerous machine in an unpredictable, public environment, so it requires full concentration at all times. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Speed is a critical factor in all road crashes and casualties. It is estimated that for every 1mph (2km/h) reduction in average speeds, crash rates fall by an average of 5% [10]. </p>

<p><strong><u>Key advice to help you #SlowDown</u></strong> </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>On all roads, keep well below speed limits – it’s a limit not a target.</li> 
 <li>Slow down in school zones, around road works, and in communities at all times.</li> 
 <li>Passing school buses: either way its 20km/h.</li> 
 <li>Come to a complete stop at intersections and double check for children.</li> 
 <li>Slow down and double check for people at pedestrian crossings, particularly in school zones.</li>

        <title>Safety first on farm vehicles</title>
        <date>Tuesday, May 23, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Quadbike_small.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=188</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/Quadbike_small.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=188" width="188">Rural Women New Zealand calls for more awareness of farm vehicle safety in New Zealand. Recently, there have been two fatalities from the use of the “side-by-side” ATV vehicles in the South Island. These vehicles have been replacing quad bikes on farm, as they appear to be a safer option to farmers.</p> 
<p>"The term ATV is a misnomer, as these are not all-terrain-vehicles, like all vehicles they have their place and they have their limits. The best way to safely use side-by-side vehicles, is to get proper training, and always wear seat belts, even for short journeys” says Fiona Gower, National President of Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
<p>“Operators of all farm vehicles, such as ATVs, quads, two-wheelers, tractors and utes need to know the vehicle’s capabilities and practise safe riding and driving skills. They need to know how to check their vehicle to ensure it is safe to operate. The best way to achieve this is through qualified training instructors."</p> 
<p>“The time and cost of a training course is a better option than having an income stream interrupted due to being off work, health bills or in extreme circumstances, funeral costs. There are wider costs to consider, as well as the financial ones, such as physical recovery time, the emotional costs of losing a loved one, or watching them cope with the injuries received from an accident.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ understands that vehicles are essential tools on rural properties. RWNZ advises operators to choose the right vehicle for the job ahead, taking into consideration the terrain and the load being carried and the actual work required to complete. We also remind people to wear their seat belt and ensure everyone in the vehicle has their seat belt on.</p> 
<p>It is essential to undertake pre-ride checks such as “TCLOC” to ensure vehicles are at a safe standard by checking: <br><strong>T</strong>yres and wheels (including correct tyre pressure) <br><strong>C</strong>hassis <br><strong>L</strong>ights and electrics <br><strong>O</strong>il and fuel <br><strong>C</strong>ontrols.</p>

        <title>Budget 2017</title>
        <date>Friday, May 26, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/download.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/download.jpg">Budget 2017 had several areas of interest for rural, in particular for the farming sector, where there is additional funding for the Ministry of Primary Industries on biosecurity, irrigation, and trade facilitation.</p> 
<p> The Budget’s focus on spending on public services, social investment, and infrastructure will also benefit rural people. Changes to tax brackets, Working for Families and Accommodation Supplements targeted at lower and middle income families is also important.</p> 
<p> A $4.0 billion infrastructure package includes $812 million capital investment to reinstate the earthquake damaged sections of State Highway 1 from Picton to Christchurch. $548 million is also being invested in the rail network.</p> 
<p> Roading infrastructure spending has been given a boost with items such as the Huntly and Hamilton sections of the Waikato Expressway; the Whirokino trestle bridge replacement in Manawatu-Whanganui; the Mt Messenger-Awakino Gorge corridor in Taranaki; and the Motu Bridge replacement in Gisborne.</p> 
<p>Tourism infrastructure will receive $44.6 million in operations funding and $41 million in capital to ease pressure on Department of Conservation land and facilities, with an additional $9.7 million capital allocation beyond the four-year period. </p> 
<p>Primary industries benefit from an increase of $30.5 million of operating funding to upgrade and modernise the fisheries management system. Setting aside $100 million of under-utilised Crown land to build houses, means less horticultural land is likely to be used for housing.</p> 
<p> An additional $59.2 million over four years has been set aside to ensure all road ambulance call outs are double crewed by 2021, by creating 375 new emergency medical and paramedic roles across the country. This will directly benefit a number of rural districts in New Zealand.</p> 
<p> Budget 2017 also allocated additional grant funding of $26.7 million over the next three years, plus a capital boost of $63 million towards irrigation projects.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/pregnancy-1430513.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=202" width="202">Maternity services have come under the spotlight with the announcement that an anonymous group of midwives has sent a complaint alleging that midwifery is at a crisis point to the Health and Disability Commissioner.</p> 
<p>The letter is now being handled by the Ministry of Health (as confirmed to the Otago Daily Times newspaper). While the contents of the 33-page letter are not known to the public, Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) has concerns in two areas.&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<p>This letter comes at a time when smaller maternity units are being threatened by closure, meaning that women living in rural areas will no longer have a choice in where they give birth and will have to go to larger urban areas away from home and family. </p> 
<p>RWNZ can name maternity hospitals in Te Anau, Lumsden and Tutatapere in the South Island and Te Kuiti in the North that are currently under threat of closure. Government and DHB’s will claim that the services are being under-used, but the reality for newly pregnant women when they must make a choice about where they will give birth, is that the uncertainty of a smaller hospital’s future leaves them with no choice than to go to an urban area.</p> 
<p>Rural women are already at a disadvantage with their maternity care. During the first three months of pregnancy, the midwife and the mother must come to an agreement over the number of visits made at home once the baby has been born. It is appreciated that distance and time for midwives to travel to rural areas is an issue and that the seven, or more home visits are unlikely to happen with the current level of recompense that midwives receive. Most will agree to one visit with the expectation that the mother will then be able to travel to a clinic for the aftercare that they are entitled to.</p> 
<p>In most cases, the arrangement works unless the new mother has had a caesarean birth and is unable to drive for six weeks. Not only is she deprived of essential aftercare, in some cases they can be isolated from other support services and family. There may be further issues when the new mother is a migrant worker, or English is a second language, or where there is a variable income. The demands of seasonal farm work will often play their part too, and it is not always possible for a farmer to stop work over the six week period of midwife aftercare to transport the new mother and baby to appointments.</p> 
<p>Government and DHB’s need to accept responsibility for optimum care for new mothers and babies at a time in life when the need for guidance and advice is crucial. The early days of a baby’s life and the ability of the mother to adapt and cope with new demands are crucial for the future health of the baby. Care delivered at this early stage is an investment in the lifetime health of a child.</p> 
<p>Whatever the outcome from the letter the midwives have sent, it will be founded on genuine deep concern for the health of mother and babies, and Rural Women New Zealand is hopeful that their concerns will be considered with that knowledge in mind. </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand believes that all women regardless of their geographical location deserve equity of maternity services.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/gypsy day.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=167" width="167">June 1st is Gypsy Day, when new dairy contacts come into action around the country. Many farmers, their family and staff will be moving around the country to their next farms.</p> 
<p>Farmers and their families will be packing up houses and sheds, including pets and stock. People will need to take extra care when travelling as there will be numerous removal trucks, utes and trailer-loads of equipment and stock on the road.&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<p>Farmers may be leaving family and friends behind when they move to new areas. They will need to build support networks and find out about local schools and other community services. This can be challenging as many farms are located in isolated areas, which makes it harder to meet neighbours and get involved in the community. </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) can assist with social connections and contacts for local support agencies. RWNZ branches are located throughout the country and regularly organise get-togethers for women and their families to meet and build social networks through activities and events in their community. </p> 
<p>Come meet us at Fieldays 14-17 June at Mystery Creek. The RWNZ stand will be inside the health hub alongside support agencies and health services. Board representatives and members will be on the stand to answer queries about RWNZ and branches in your area.</p> 
<p>Coming up in Otorohanga on Tuesday 13 June, a free Women's Wellbeing workshop features speakers from RWNZ and local support agencies. Learn how to recognise the signs of a healthy relationship and develop strategies to support friends and families who may be experiencing difficulties. </p> 
<p>In Te Awamutu on Tuesday 20 June, Te Rahu RWNZ Branch are hosting a Comedy Cup event. People are invited to attend wearing fun or fabulous race-day outfits, and participate in quizzes and activities, including a competition for best fascinator. </p> 
<p>Join in the activities of a RWNZ branch near you, events are listed on our website <a href="http://www.ruralwomen.org.nz">www.ruralwomen.org.nz</a> or follow us on Facebook/ruralwomennz or Twitter @ruralwomennz or freephone 0800 256 467 for RWNZ contacts in your region.</p>

        <title>Submission on Domestic Violence Victims' Protection Bill</title>
        <date>Friday, June 02, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Woman on phone_cropped.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=131</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/Woman on phone_cropped.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=131" width="131">Green Party MP Jan Logie’s Domestic Violence - Victims’ Protection Bill is before Parliament and RWNZ asks Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse and his fellow MPs to support the Bill.</p> 
<p>The Bill seeks to address harms experienced by victims, by focusing on how workplaces can be made a safer and more accommodating place for victims. It would extend leave provisions to include domestic violence leave, as when women leave a violent situation it can be very hard for them to manage court proceedings, counselling, housing and the needs of their children without extra leave.&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<p>Work at a regular time and place can make work a target for the abuser, but with employer support through flexible working arrangements, that can be adjusted to support the employee. </p> 
<p>“RWNZ believe that the Bill will have an impact on people who are victims of domestic violence and help support them when they need to leave the relationship,” says Fiona Gower, RWNZ National President.</p> 
<p>“Rural women often have to travel long distances between home and work and it can be very difficult for them to move away from a violent relationship. </p> 
<p>“The services for helping victims of domestic violence are mostly located in urban areas. Enabling rural women to take time off work to access services, is a step toward helping them to move away from a violent home, and setting a plan in place to rebuild their lives.”</p> 
<p>RWNZ recently made a submission on the Government’s family violence law changes, in support of adding protection of animals to legislation. Violence to animals is often part of the package of abuse. Comments were also made about the lack of near-neighbours and isolation in general, also a woman’s support is often from friends and family of the perpetrator. </p> 
<p>RWNZ have worked closely with the Ministry of Social Development on the campaign: ‘It’s Not OK‘. RWNZ have held several workshops with the Sophie Elliott Foundation spreading the message of how to recognise healthy relationships, and how to assist someone who is not in a healthy relationship.</p> 
<a href="/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=227927" title="April 2017 Domestic Violence Bill">Read the Domestic Violence submission here</a> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Response to Supplementary Order Paper&nbsp;</b> </p> 
<p>On 1 May, the Justice and Electoral Committee published a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP), which proposes changes to the Domestic Violence-Victims’ Protection Bill. </p> 
<p>These changes include allowing employees who have experienced domestic violence to request flexible arrangements no matter how long they have been an employee, requiring employers to respond to requests within a period of five working days once received, and allowing employees who have had their requests denied to seek urgent mediation.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand has submitted on the SOP, believing that the proposed changes will be costly and onerous for rural employers. RWNZ has proposed that the government provide funding or reimbursement for employers for domestic violence paid leave; a recognition that the burden of compliance is greater for Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), especially for those in rural and small towns; a timeframe for employers’ to provide flexible working arrangements that is reasonable and reflective of the nature of the business; and a stand down period should apply before any entitlement can apply.</p>

        <title>Firearms education programmes in schools</title>
        <date>Tuesday, June 13, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/blog/shooting_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=134</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/shooting_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=134" width="134">Rural Women New Zealand is a strong supporter for education programmes in schools on all matter of safety in rural environments which includes firearm use. The aim is to increase student and teacher awareness of how to use firearms safely.</p> 
<p>In past years, RWNZ has delivered workshops with primary schools on risks in the rural environment, such as animal safety, ATVs, poisons, water safety, civil defence, road safety, rural fires and home security. This included sessions on firearms safety.&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<p>“Research shows that teaching children at a young age how to handle firearms safely, decreases non-intentional firearms incidents, resulting in lives being saved,” says Rachael Dean, RWNZ Finance Chair and RWNZ representative on Firearm’s Safety Council and Firearm’s Community Advisory Forum.</p> 
<p>“Towards the end of the 1960’s, statistics show that on average, children were involved in an incident a month from a non-intentional discharge of a firearm. Once education around firearms was introduced, the statistics dropped dramatically.” </p> 
<p>Firearms are part of the rural environment and the first concern in educating children in firearms use is safety. Learning to shoot under suitable supervision teaches self-discipline, self-control, hand-eye coordination and concentration. The benefit of firearms’ training in schools is to educate students and adults to help create a better safety culture on farms and lifestyle blocks.</p>]]></body>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/shotgun-2-1429440_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=184" width="184">Rural Women New Zealand is reassured that the Minister of Police, Paula Bennett, has heard the concerns of our members through our response to the Select Committee report into the illegal possession of firearms.</p> 
<p>Minister Bennett has rejected 12 of the 20 report recommendations made by the Select Committee. Those recommendations would have significantly impacted on licensed firearms owners but done little to stop firearms getting into the hands of criminals. <br> </p> 
<p>The Select Committee’s terms of reference were to focus on how widespread firearms possession is among criminals, how those people who do not have a firearms licence come into possession of firearms, and what changes, if any, would restrict the flow of firearms to criminals, gangs and people who do not hold a licence.</p> 
<p>“This is a positive change for hunters, farmers and shooters,” says Rachael Dean, RWNZ Finance Chair and RWNZ representative on Firearm’s Safety Council and Firearm’s Community Advisory Forum. “Instead of adding to the burdens of licensed firearms’ owners in rural areas, the Minister has placed the focus firmly back on the non-law abiding firearms users.” </p> 
<p>Minister Bennett says the policy changes needed to “strike the right balance between public safety and the rights of legal firearms owners. Nobody wants firearms getting into the hands of violent gang members but we also don’t want over the top rules and restrictions to be placed on hunters and shooters who manage their firearms responsibly.”</p>

        <title>Boarding Allowance Scheme Survey</title>
        <date>Monday, June 19, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/blog/study-table-1412822-1279x852.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=190</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/study-table-1412822-1279x852.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=190" width="190" style="border-style: solid;float: left;"> RWNZ recently sent out a survey on Boarding Bursaries, asking members a series of questions, to enable us to provide evidence-based data around the key issues on how the costs of boarding students and the associated issues impact on our rural families.</p> 
<p>The information provided formed the report to the Ministry of Education in response to the review on access and the multiple barriers allowances offered by the Ministry of Education’s Boarding Allowance Scheme.&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<p>Eighty survey responses were received, and while each had its own individual comments, there were some common themes. </p> 
<p>Question one asked whether or not people believed the value of access barriers and multiple allowance barriers is sufficient. A minority believe the value is sufficient because it is only an assistance, however the majority believe it falls short of the ever-increasing costs of boarding school and fails to take into account certain family circumstances, such as a one parent household, multiple children or a low income household. </p> 
<p>As a result of not attending boarding school, children can face disadvantages such as a limited range of extra-curricular activities, or attending a local school which “may not provide a very high standard of education, holding bright children back from achieving their potential.” </p> 
<p>Respondents were also asked whether they believed there were families who are eligible to receive allowances but do not apply. Surprisingly, a majority said that they do know of families in this position. Some parents have had issues in the past, and find the process stressful. Other parents have simply not been aware the allowances exist, and it was suggested schools should have an obligation to advise families about allowances. Some stated the opposite, that in their communities almost everyone applies because the majority are low to middle income earners, and need all financial assistance available. </p> 
<p>When asked whether they believed the eligibility criteria are set at the right level, most people disagreed. Those who disagreed believe the distance criteria are too high, and fail to take into account rural areas with rough terrain and narrow windy roads. It can be difficult for families living in isolated areas traveling on gravel roads that are slower to negotiate. However, those who agreed also mentioned there probably needs to be some flexibility for unique cases. </p> 
<p>There are many consequences for families who cannot board due to financial reasons. For the child, common consequences include isolation, lack of social contact, lack of friendships and the ability to build new relationships, and a lack of participation in cultural, sporting and other activities. The effect on the whole family includes the cost and stress of relocating, and in some cases dividing the family. </p> 
<p>From the survey, the proposed solution is that all children should be given the option to go to boarding school if they wish. They should also have the ability to return back home after their studies as a fulfilled citizen, passionate and influential, with a desire to give back to the community they originated from. The access barriers facing families today that wish to send a child to boarding school are perceived to be a lot harder than in previous years. </p> 
<p><strong>Great Barrier Island </strong> </p> 
<p>There were a large number of responses from Great Barrier Island where the issue of boarding allowances is a “hot topic”, and because they are a small and close-knit community, families regularly engage in open and frank discussions. While correspondence is an option, there were many issues, and are still, with the Correspondence School: Te Kura. Also, correspondence does not fit with every child’s learning needs. </p> 
<p>These children take correspondence due to lack of money, and it is felt on the island that they are not receiving a proper education. To make matters worse, this increases their chance of gravitating towards and becoming involved in social activities with negative outcomes. </p> 
<p>Great Barrier Island believe that the allowances should also be area-based, and not subject to distance criteria.</p>

        <title>Myrtle Rust outbreak what you need to know</title>
        <date>Thursday, June 29, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/blog/ResizedImageWzMyMCwyMzhd-myrtle-rust-on-leaves.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/ResizedImageWzMyMCwyMzhd-myrtle-rust-on-leaves.jpg">Myrtle rust (<em>Austropuccinia psidii</em>) has been found in Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Taranaki.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The fungus attacks various species of plants in the Myrtaceae family, also known as the myrtle family. It is found in many parts of the world including New Caledonia and all along Australia's eastern seaboard. <br> </p> 
<p>Myrtle rust spores are microscopic and can easily spread across large distances by wind, or via insects, birds, people, or machinery.</p> 
<p>It is thought the fungus arrived in New Zealand carried by strong winds from Australia. There have been a number of significant weather events capable of transporting spores here and the discovery of the disease in large, established trees lends weight to this assumption.</p> 
<p>MPI and the Department of Conservation (DOC), with the help of local iwi, the nursery industry and local authorities are running a large operation to determine the scale of the situation and contain and control myrtle rust in the areas it has been found.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>If you think you've seen the symptoms of myrtle rust, don't touch it.</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Call the MPI Exotic Pest and Disease Hotline immediately on 0800 80 99 66.</strong> </li> 
 <li><strong>If you have a camera or phone camera, take clear photos, including the whole plant, the whole affected leaf, and a close-up of the spores or affected area of the plant.</strong> </li> 
 <li><strong>Don't touch it or try to collect samples as this may increase the spread of the disease.</strong> </li> 
</ul> 
<h3><strong>Don't move myrtle plants or green waste out of &nbsp;Controlled Area</strong></h3> 
<p>MPI has introduced a Controlled Area which extends 10km from the known infected areas in Waitara, Taranaki.</p> 
<p>It is illegal to move plants (including trees) or plant material (such as garden waste, clippings, feijoa and guava fruit) from the myrtle family out of this area. You can still buy and plant these species inside the Controlled Area.</p> 
<p>For more details on the outbreak and how to manage plants affected by Myrtle Rust see the MPI website: <a href="http://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/responding/alerts/myrtle-rust" title="Myrtle Rust">http://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/responding/alerts/myrtle-rust</a> </p>

<p>Challenges in accessing rural health services have changed very little since 1927, when advertisements first appeared for Bush Nurses with surgical skills and maternity certificates. The advertisements were placed by the Women’s Division Emergency Housekeeping Scheme, now Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ). <br>RWNZ will present real-life stories and evidence of the realities and difficulties rural New Zealanders experience in accessing health service.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/DSCN1791-web2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=304" width="304"> <br>Rural Women New Zealand's Health Portfolio representative, Margaret Pittaway spoke at a seminar organised by the University of Otago's Wellington Medical School on Friday 21 July. Read the transcript of Margaret's speech below:&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand has been working hard to strengthen rural communities for over 90 years. We have been a Leading Voice for rural Families and Communities since our beginning in 1925 in the areas of Health, Education, Social and Environment. </p> 
<p>The issues in the 1920’s that affected the women, their families and their communities still exist today - isolation, lack of services and agency support. Their concerns were around health and education for themselves and their families, being connected to the outside world and being able to access the services they required.</p> 
<p>In the time I have with you today, I want to talk about the difficulties rural New Zealanders face in their day to day lives in accessing health services, and to give you some of the reasons Rural Women New Zealand believe to be the main cause of our problems</p> 
<p>The Organisation began 92 years ago when a group of very determined farmer’s wives took the opportunity to meet in Wellington while their husbands attended the Farmers Union Conference. These women recognised the need for representation and support for rural women in the areas affecting the welfare of women and children, and they were concerned at the stories they were hearing of loneliness, illness and lack of assistance.</p> 
<p>One of the prime needs was to organise reliable help to step in when the women were ill, needed support when there was a new baby, or when they needed to leave home for a time. This was the beginning of the Women’s Division Emergency Housekeeping Scheme, and in April 1927 advertisements appeared for ‘House Keeper, willing to do anything’ and for’ Bush nurse with surgical skills and maternity certificate.’</p> 
<p>These nurses were the beginning of the District Nursing Service and Community Midwives. Nurse’s wages were subsidised with donations from all over the country. The numbers employed were initially quite small, and then the Government of the day began to set up cottage hospitals and a District Nursing Service and the need for our Bush Nurses disappeared.</p> 
<p>During this same era, homes were purchased throughout the country to enable members to have respite care when the need arose, or to take a family holiday for very little cost. When there was no longer the same need for this service, the homes were sold and the funds were used to set up a company, Access Home Help which operated throughout the country and continued to provide care to rural areas in spite of the time and travel costs involved – the only company to do so. Access was sold in 2014 and continues to operate in the same manner.</p> 
<p>In 2000, the results of a Rural Health Survey undertaken by Rural Women New Zealand were released with the hope and idea that they would be used as a basis for planning for health services by DHB’s and other parties. Today I acknowledge this document as it remains relevant and was helpful to me as I was preparing this presentation. </p> 
<p>In 2016, Rural Women New Zealand undertook to study rural communities in New Zealand so that we gained a better understanding of what and where the problem areas are. Other than this document, there is very little to find in the way of rural research, but we have found that this document is a valuable tool for us, particularly when we are preparing submissions. Rather than being a negative work, it gives examples of positive actions which have meant that the fortunes of communities have been turned around, both in New Zealand and in overseas communities.</p> 
<p>The biggest disadvantage for rural New Zealand is that there is no accurate definition of rural. Government uses the NZ Statistics definition of rural which divides into four categories, Rural with high urban influence, Rural with moderate urban influence, Rural with low urban influence and highly rural remote. What these categories mean is that 40% of people who access rural health services are classified as urban, while a further 20% of people currently classified as rural, access their help from urban.</p> 
<p>In response to a very recent request from our national office for information on statistics for cervical cancer and for the uptake of immunisation, with comparison between urban and rural settings, the reply from the Ministry of Health was;</p> 
<p>‘Generally speaking, the Ministry doesn’t do much analysis looking at urban/rural discrepancies because there are some inherent biases in the way automated geo-coding copes with non-specific addresses. These addresses (which are more likely to be rural) tend to get re-coded at the nearest Post office. This means that a sizeable portion of rural people are recorded as urban making any attempt to draw meaningful conclusions impossible.’ </p> 
<p>This statement on its own underlines the absolute need for rural research. We currently have a rural population of some 620,000, making it effectively our second largest city, though widespread throughout the country, and yet we continually struggle to get the equivalent services that the rest of the New Zealand population expects.</p> 
<p>We just do not have sufficient information to provide evidence based interventions to most effectively create better health outcomes.</p> 
<p>What we and other key rural organisations would like to see is the system of rural proofing of Government Policies re- introduced. The system is used in the United Kingdom and ensures that the impact of changes in government to rural communities with low population density is taken into account as plans for change are developed. </p> 
<p>So, what are the concerns we have, and what are the realities in accessing health care that rural New Zealanders face?</p> 
<p>Let’s start with Maternity Services, and some information shared with me by a young woman living in Te Anau, a major, but isolated tourist town with a growing younger population.</p> 
<p> The nearest available mid wife lives in Tuatapere, 101K’s distant and her back up midwife has her home in Riverton, a distance of 147 K’s. Although there are two other midwives who do work in Te Anau they do not live in the area, and they both have a full case load. Further, there is no opportunity to access Ante-Natal classes in the area. </p> 
<p>The nearest birthing unit is in Lumsden, 77Km distant, but as with a number of units throughout the country, it is in danger of being closed, and so young women are making the decision to go to Invercargill to have their babies as they feel safer there, and they want assurance that the unit will still be operating when they do go into Labour.</p> 
<p>This is a trend that is happening throughout the country which is regrettable, but understandable, but if these units continue to close, it leaves no options to have extra time after the birth in a unit where there are staff to assist a new mum and baby in those all-important first few days. Most birthing units encourage their new mums to return home early, with no thought for a farming mum who will be quickly caught up in the day to day business of farming life, and with no support services close to hand. There is not much rest for a rural woman! And there <u>is</u> provision for a midwife to arrange for longer stay in the birthing unit or other facility on the grounds of geographical isolation.</p> 
<p>During the first Trimester the midwife must discuss with her client the plans for managing her pregnancy and the six weeks following birth. An agreement of expectations about the number of post-natal visits must be reached. New mums are entitled to seven, but they may not be requested or required, or they agree to one home visit with the mother then undertaking to travel to a clinic for the other post-natal checks. There is no problem with that, but if a C-section was performed, the new mum is not permitted to drive for six weeks. If baby’s arrival coincided with a busy time on the farm, say lambing or harvesting, it is nigh impossible for a farmer to take his partner to an appointment, and other friends or neighbours are likely to be busy too. The value of regular checks in those first weeks cannot be understated as they provide the opportunities to ensure that there are no unrecognised signs of child or maternal problems, to say nothing of the reassurances that new mothers seek.</p> 
<p>We haven’t touched on the birth yet, but if lengthy travel to the birthing unit is required, then careful planning is needed to ensure that the pregnant mum is resident in the area before labour begins. Get it wrong, and the stress and anxiety mount, to say nothing of enduring contractions on unsealed bumpy roads in adverse weather conditions.</p> 
<p>Midwives have reported on the difficulties of using ambulance services to transport labouring women experiencing difficulties, to a primary birthing unit. The irony <strong>is</strong>, that if you break a leg on the ski field attempting something way beyond your capabilities, there are no questions about the need for a helicopter. What price the life and wellbeing of a mother and baby?</p> 
<p>We don’t know whether our children are disadvantaged because they have poorer access to maternity and youth health services than urban children. There is no dataavailable.</p> 
<p>The rural population is facing the reality of an ageing and burnt out GP workforce and a seemingly dwindling number of younger doctors who are willing to take up the challenges and rewards of working in rural areas, despite best efforts to promote and attract. The uncertainties around continued local medical services takes its own toll on our rural communities with reluctance for families to work in areas where the facilities are unreliable. Add the lack of ultra-fast broad band and poor cell phone coverage, still experienced in many areas and it becomes apparent why there is a reluctance to work in these areas.</p> 
<p>The use of locums means that a relationship of knowledge and trust is difficult to build, and for our older patients in particular, this is a very real problem.</p> 
<p>Currently, 25% of rural General Practices are seeking a full time GP and over a third of pharmacies are having difficulty with recruitment.</p> 
<p>Consider the need for an Out Patient appointment for a family member. Urban dwellers would maybe allow two hours out of their day to get to the hospital, find parking attend their 15 minute appointment and be on their way home or back to work again soon afterwards.</p> 
<p>For someone living in the country the reality is different where travel is a necessity. Hospitals are not always good at recognising that a patient has to make a real effort to attend an early morning appointment and that it may mean an overnight stay. Travel costs are prohibitive to many, as are accommodation costs.</p> 
<p>For many, a specialist appointment can mean an eight to nine hour round trip and loss of a day’s wages or work. Yes, there are increasing opportunities for tele-health consultations, but generally speaking, the majority of patients will need to travel for their appointments.</p> 
<p>The distance that cancer patients have to travel for treatment are significantly further for those living in rural areas Often women with breast cancer will choose a more aggressive treatment in order to get home to their families, and any patient undergoing prolonged treatment will struggle with the travelling and the distance, particularly if they have no one else to drive them.</p> 
<p>Difficulty is often experienced in accessing drug and alcohol services and counselling services.</p> 
<p>Accidents in rural areas pose more problems. We are reliant on a largely volunteer ambulance service which means that the crew need to be called into the station before the ambulance can leave. Time lost. In most rural areas, stabilising the patients for transport to a base hospital is the main aim. In severe cases, helicopters can be called in to transport, but that takes time too, and adverse winter conditions may mean that the choppers can’t fly. Time lost. Winter road conditions for ambulance transfer may well mean a slower than normal trip. More time lost, and the reality for many of us is that the base hospital is three hours by road in good driving conditions. </p> 
<p>Consider also that many of our high density tourist traffic areas have very poor cell phone coverage which can mean more time delays to get urgent help.</p> 
<p>Let me touch briefly on the volunteer system that is the reality for the rural population. Don’t get me wrong. The people who volunteer in any service to their community are fabulous, but it comes at a cost to both them and to their families. On call means just that – the need to abandon all plans and activities to answer an urgent call out, sometimes in the middle of the night. Depending on the reason for a call out, realistically it could involve hours with the initial need for assessment, stabilisation, transfer, hand over, return journey home and then clean up and re-stocking time so that the ambulance is ready for the next call.</p> 
<p>Many of our volunteers also have day jobs and responsibilities which they have to consider, as well as the fact that training is undertaken in their own time without full recompense. Volunteer ambulance staff is being put under increasing pressure as they are filling gaps being left behind by 24 hour services that have been centralised. Not only do our volunteers need our recognition and continual support, but also their families who miss out on family time.</p> 
<p>We are all aware of the state of our mental health services in this country. Ponder for a moment on what this means for rural communities where we have a high suicide rate in our farming communities and particularly in the male 20 – 25 year age group. Rural Support trustees report that when they have a suicidal client, they have little problem accessing GP assistance, but when it comes to getting further help in the form of an urgent appointment from Brief Intervention services, the wait can be from 10 days to three weeks. Not good enough. Can you just imagine the anxiety and stress that the family will experience during this time? </p> 
<p>Consider those who patients in hospital who are sometimes discharged at short notice, to make way for another patient, at times in the middle of the night. If they live in a rural area and have been brought in by ambulance or a friend or family member- how do to they get home? Or where do they go if they have no family in the area? - very distressing, especially for the elderly. </p> 
<p>There is unlikely to be any available public transport, many are not permitted to drive after surgery, and so are reliant on someone yet again being able to take time out to collect them. And home could be a good distance away.</p> 
<p>Often when patients are discharged from hospital they require on going care – maybe wound care, maybe drug administration or assistance with the usually simple tasks of showering and dressing. In an urban situation it is simple as the District Nursing Service is able to administer those treatments. Not so for rural patients, and we have had a number of our members approach us for help and advice when treatment at home has been refused for a family member. I do not use the word refuse lightly, as I have been told by nurses, that the service and the extra costs of travel to rural areas is just not within the budget allowances of the District Nursing Service, and even worse, that if people choose to live in remote areas it’s their own fault.</p> 
<p>So how do we get around the problem of getting continuing treatment once a patient is discharged? Some elderly people may qualify for respite care for a short time, but for the majority, it means frequent travel to a medical centre for the cares that are needed, involving not only time and travel costs, but fees incurred at the Medical Centre.</p> 
<p>I have briefly touched on connectivity, but I want to return to the topic as it is in fact a major issue in rural areas for a number of reasons. </p> 
<p>Firstly for Safety and access to emergency services.</p> 
<p>When an accident occurs in a rural area, there is often no cell phone coverage because of black spots, and so it requires someone to find access to a landline, or find somewhere where there is cell phone coverage to ring for help. Not always easy if those seeking help are visitors to the country, or are unsure of the area they are in. And if those involved are injured themselves, they may not be able to send for help. Unfortunately much of the vital “Golden Hour” can be taken up finding help. </p> 
<p>As an example, a farmer who had an accident with a digger and badly injured his hand was fortunate that he had satellite internet, so he was able to call for help. Phone service had been out for weeks and there was no coverage for cell phones. </p> 
<p>A further example – In a small settlement where the phones were out of order, a motorcyclist on an event was injured. In this instance, a helper had to drive 20 minutes to the nearest town, then drive another 20 minutes to find a phone that worked, while the injured person lay in pain until help arrived. The nearest ambulance was over an hour away. Even with a first response team on site it was an unpleasant wait- if cell phone coverage had been available, that wait time would have been considerably less.</p> 
<p>In an emergency where there is only a landline already in use for contacting emergency services, there is then no opportunity to call for extra assistance from close neighbours or friends. It can be a traumatic and distressing time for everyone involved.</p> 
<p>I spoke earlier about the pending closure of maternity hospitals, and I wish to make further comment, and this time, include some of the smaller general hospitals.</p> 
<p>The downgrading and closure of rural hospitals has left a gap in rural health and emergency services in communities throughout the country, for they provided an essential focus and service to the communities they served. The effects are variable but the increased separation between patients and vital services is creating barriers to access to health services. </p> 
<p>Kurow is a small service town in North Otago. Its Medical Centre is open four days a week and an afterhours service is provided by volunteers. The town pharmacy closed some time ago, and until recently, prescriptions were brought down by car daily form Twizel, and delivered to a local shop owner who was licensed to give the prescriptions to the locals when they called in. Regrettably, the owner has decided not to renew her license and so now a car drives from Twizel each day and parks on the street for one hour so that prescriptions can be collected, and then returns to Twizel with any unclaimed prescriptions – a round trip of 158 K’s and a service that is not convenient for the local population. Has anyone given consideration to the safety of the person in the car if it becomes known more widely of the contents?</p> 
<p>Bill, aged 82 and a long-time resident of Kurow has a number of health issues including prostate problems and blindness in one eye. He has been waiting at great length for eye surgery with no operation date on the horizon yet. He is unable to do much at all in his daily living. Bill’s comment on the situation, apart from his disillusionment with the state of the health system, is that he has had enough and is ready to die.</p> 
<p>This brings me to my final point. Evidence from a number of countries states that those who live rurally have poorer health than their urban counterparts.</p> 
<p>“There is little information about the prevalence of of illness or disease among our rural populations, but it is reasonable to assume that its rates of illness or disease are similar to those of New Zealand’s total population. However, once diagnosed, rural people unquestionably face greater challenges and costs of access to health services and specialist treatments. It is also reasonable to assume that there is a greater impact of disease or illness on rural people and their families. It is also a reasonable assumption that this results in poorer health outcomes.”</p> 
<p>I acknowledge the help and support from my peers, our National Office staff and the health organisations who we work with in partnership.</p> 
<p>I hope today that Rural Women New Zealand has successfully brought our concerns to you and that the word will be spread that our rural population deserves better treatment and consideration.</p>

        <title>Marriage Amendment Bill</title>
        <date>Tuesday, July 25, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/Ringsweb.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Ringsweb.jpg">The Justice and Electoral Committee is seeking feedback on the Marriage (Court Consent to Marriage of Minors) Amendment Bill. RWNZ's submission fully supports the Bill and its intent to prevent forced marriages from occurring in New Zealand by requiring minors aged 16 and 17 to gain approval by the Family Court in order to marry.</p> 
<p>In our submission, RWNZ cited various international conventions and declarations of which New Zealand is a signatory or party to that do not condone forced marriage. These include the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). RWNZ expressed that the proposed amendment to New Zealand’s marriage law upholds New Zealand’s commitment to these documents. <br> </p> 
<p>RWNZ also noted that the law as it currently stands, which allows minors aged 16 and 17 to marry with parental consent, is insufficient in preventing forced marriage. The proposed amendment serves as a precaution to prevent parental guardians from attempting to facilitate a forced marriage. </p> 
<p>As further information becomes available, this will be distributed to the members.</p>

        <title>Suicide Prevention Strategy Submission</title>
        <date>Wednesday, July 26, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/couple walking.jpg</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/couple walking.jpg" width="158"> The Ministry of Health has proposed a new framework for suicide prevention and is seeking feedback. Rural Women New Zealand’s (RWNZ) submission supports the general framework.</p>Although expresses concern regarding the lack of concrete targets and detailed methods for how any of the initiatives will be implemented. We are especially concerned about the lack of a strategic plan to lead and fund these activities. 
<p>The proposed framework aims to address the devastating impact that suicide has on New Zealand’s communities and the unfortunate reality that over 500 people in New Zealand die by suicide every year. RWNZ supports the framework’s focus on supporting positive wellbeing for all ages, increasing awareness of suicidal behaviour and mental health, strengthening systems already in place to support communities, and improving collaboration among those working to prevent suicidal behaviour. <br> </p> 
<p>In our submission, we have addressed the fact that the suicide rate is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, as well as the various factors that place rural communities at an increased risk of mental illness. These factors include vulnerability to economic fluctuations and social isolation, which are compounded by the lack of access to services and support, substandard or no access to reliable and affordable internet and mobile coverage, and the history of inequalities that rural communities face often being overlooked. </p> 
<p>RWNZ has suggested that in order to improve mental wellbeing in rural areas, rural health research must become a priority to understand and address the needs of rural communities. We have also urged the Ministry of Health to refrain from relying on technological health services, recognising that not all rural communities have access to reliable and affordable internet and mobile coverage. </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand strongly supports the framework’s proposal to involve, train and educate community members on suicide prevention. Rural Women New Zealand has expressed that it is essential for rural communities to be provided with the right tools to improve mental wellbeing within the community and reduce social stigma associated with mental illness.</p> 
<p>As further information becomes available, this will be distributed to the members.</p>

        <title>Equity of access, funding and training concerns for draft Digital Technologies curriculum</title>
        <date>Thursday, August 10, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/class-room-1574035-web2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=135</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/class-room-1574035-web2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=135" width="135">The Ministry of Education is seeking feedback on the draft Digital Technologies | Hangarau Matihiko (DT|HM) curriculum. </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand’s (RWNZ) submission supports the curriculum and its intent to prepare New Zealand’s students for the increasingly digital world. However, RWNZ is concerned about the curriculum being applied in rural areas, where there is not equitable access to digital technologies. </p>
<p>The three core issues with implementing the DT|HM curriculum that RWNZ has focused on in the submission are the lack of sufficient funding for rural schools, training for teachers, and access to reliable internet connectivity. RWNZ noted that although access to reliable broadband has improved in rural schools, not all rural homes and communities are sufficiently equipped. Therefore, rural students that do not have access to reliable internet would be unable to complete the required coursework outside of school hours. </p> 
<p>“It is vital that all students in New Zealand have access to all learning opportunities,” says RWNZ National President, Fiona Gower. “They shouldn't be missing these opportunities because of funding or training restrictions or because of where they live. There needs to be equity for all, so no children are left behind in the learning of what is now considered an important part of the curriculum.”</p> 
<p>In the submission, RWNZ has requested that the curriculum include a strategic plan that will ensure all schools are provided with adequate resources so that learning outcomes can be consistent across the country. This plan should include a training budget to be used for professional learning and development in the use of digital technologies for teachers; ensuring access to reliable internet connectivity both at school and in homes; and providing all schools and students with the same technology and other resources needed to implement the curriculum.</p>

        <title>Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill (No2) Submission</title>
        <date>Thursday, August 10, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/old-farm-1211976_WEB2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=176</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/old-farm-1211976_WEB2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=176" width="176">The Justice and Electoral Committee is seeking feedback on the Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill (No 2). </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand’s (RWNZ) submission supports the intent of the Bill, especially in regards to the protection of landlords and tenants from the harmful effects of methamphetamine contamination. However, there are ways in which the Bill could improve to provide greater protections for landlords and tenants. </p> 
<p>RWNZ recognises that the manufacture of methamphetamine is a widespread, clandestine issue in New Zealand. In our submission, RWNZ noted that the lack of police resources in rural areas can make them a target location for methamphetamine manufacture because there is less risk of getting caught. RWNZ also referenced a case study that shows how harmful methamphetamine contamination in homes can be to the health of tenants, especially children. </p> 
<p>In order to provide greater protection for tenants, RWNZ suggested that landlords must be held liable to test for methamphetamine contamination before a tenant moves in if requested by the incoming tenant. In regards to the high cost of methamphetamine testing, RWNZ recommended that the Bill be amended to state that tenants responsible for the methamphetamine contamination should be responsible for all costs involved with the damage that are not covered by a landlord’s insurance. This removes an undue burden on landlords, who should not be held liable to pay the costs incurred by methamphetamine contamination. </p> 
<p>"Tenants must be made responsible for the damage they cause to the landlord's property,” says Fiona Gower, National President of Rural Women New Zealand. “This includes the cost of remediating contamination caused by tenants who use or manufacture methamphetamine.”</p>

        <title>Submission on water conservation order on Ngaruroro River and Clive River</title>
        <date>Monday, August 28, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/kids-at-the-pond-1256630.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=228</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/kids-at-the-pond-1256630.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=228" width="228">RWNZ has made a submission on an application to the Minister for the Environment for a water conservation order on the Ngaruroro River and Clive River, pursuant to Section 201(1) of the Resource Management Act 1991.</p> 
<p>RWNZ opposes aspects of the application for the water conservation order that propose to limit the take of water from the lower River, in particular below Whanawhana. Consistent with other applications submitted (eg: Irrigation NZ, HB Fruitgrowers, and Horticulture NZ) we oppose the application applying to connected groundwater of the Ngaruroro River and consider that the applicants have not defined the nature or extent of the groundwater they propose to be covered by the order.&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<p>Should the Tribunal determine that the application is appropriate for the lower River, we oppose the range of controls and prohibitions suggested within the draft order for the stretch below Whanawhana Cableway. We propose that an alternative range of controls, limits and restrictions be considered that are enabling of food, fibre and wine production values. </p> 
<p>We consider that food, wine and fibre production are values that are integral to the cultural identity and economic wellbeing of the local communities and any revised water conservation order should consider the protection of those values because they are outstanding, both nationally and regionally.</p> 
<p>We note that the applicants have failed to consider the needs of rural families and communities who derive their livelihood from primary and secondary production. The region is a food producing region and many rural families and communities are dependent on and involved in the primary or secondary production industries and their service industries in some way. </p> 
<p>It is apparent to us that the applicants have not given due consideration to the downstream consequences of reducing the ability for producers of food, fibre and wine to have access to the necessary water to grow their crops. We need to ensure that crops are viable and the irrigation of crops is fundamental to that viability, especially in low rainfall seasons. <strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p>RWNZ recognises that it is sometimes difficult to balance the environmental interests and the interests of recreation users and growers and producers. We submit that the interests of people who make a living from the land and the communities that derive their living from the production and manufacture of primary produce must be fairly factored into the equation.</p> 
<p>Should the application be approved as submitted it would have the effect of disadvantaging the economic welfare of both the producers of wine and food and the other local businesses that gain their income from the revenue generated by the producers.</p>

        <title>Faster rollout of broadband and mobile will improve connectivity to rural homes</title>
        <date>Friday, September 01, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/unplugged-2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=197</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/unplugged-2.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=197" width="197">The Government has announced that an extra $270 million will be spent on improving rural broadband and bridging cellphone blackspots in regions throughout New Zealand.</p> 
<p>$130m will be spent on expanding fibre-optic ultrafast broadband (UFB) to another 60,000 homes and businesses in 190 towns. <br> </p> 
<p>$140m will extend the number of subsidised wireless broadband services to another 74,000 homes and businesses, as well as deliver mobile coverage to approximately 1000km of rural highways and more than 100 tourist areas.</p> 
<p>Once completed, UFB will be available to 87 per cent of the population and 99 per cent will have access to high speed internet by 2022.</p> 
<p>“The benefits of extra spending to expand connectivity for rural communities are immense. The services will lead to greater economic growth and better access to online education, social services and health information,” says Fiona Gower, National President of Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
<p>“Rural residents will feel safer with better mobile coverage, and the connectivity will reduce the feeling of isolation for those living in remote areas.”</p> 
<p>In the past few years, RWNZ has been involved in discussions with nationwide broadband and mobile service providers and government agencies to ensure that rural connectivity remains a top priority. RWNZ is a member of the Telecommunications Users Association of New Zealand (TUANZ) and has provided feedback to Crown Fibre Holdings on the social and economic benefits of improved rural connectivity. </p> 
<p>RWNZ policy work includes submissions on the RBI 2 and mobile black spots programmes, the draft Digital Technologies education curriculum and the Review of the Telecommunications Act 2001.</p> 
<p>While the majority of the roll out contract has been won by Chorus and a joint venture between Spark, Vodafone and 2 Degrees; smaller wireless internet providers (WISPs) will receive work worth $13m.</p> 
<p><span><a href="http://ruralwomennewzealand.cmail19.com/t/d-i-urlkwy-l-y/">Click here to read more about the roll out.</a></span> </p> 
<p><img src="/images/wizwireless_logo.jpg"> <br> </p> 
<p>We spoke to Bridget Canning who is the operator of Wizwireless which is a provider of high speed wireless internet broadband for the Wairarapa region.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“WIZwireless supports the Government in addressing the need to improve the broadband services that remote kiwis rely on and we will provide more and better services throughout the Wairarapa Region," says Bridget.</p> 
<p>“WIZwireless is delighted that the Government has recognised the vital role that Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) already play in getting reliable and effective broadband to many rural and remote New Zealanders.</p> 
<p>“WISPs all over New Zealand are going to deliver fast, modern broadband, that will meet or exceed the Government's target rural broadband specifications by using the latest fixed wireless technologies, this is how tens of thousands of rural kiwi's already get their broadband internet connections including WIZwireless.</p> 
<p>“WISP's have proven themselves to be reliable, robust and resilient, during last year's Kaikoura earthquake Amuri Net was the only telecommunications network to come through intact and provided the community with vital connectivity in the days following the earthquake.</p> 
<p>“This additional investment by the Government will allow us, the WISPs to upgrade our existing networks and build new sites that will expand our coverage to even more rural and remote internet users who are desperately in need of modern broadband connectivity.</p> 
<p>“Individual WISPs who are participating in RBI2 will release their own plans for their local RBI2 programs, we are local businesses who know our communities very well and we are excited by the opportunities that will be created by improved broadband in our communities.”</p> 
<p> </p>

        <title>RWNZ Access scholarship awarded to Far North's Roberta Kaio</title>
        <date>Tuesday, September 05, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/Roberta Kaio.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=199</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Roberta Kaio.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=199" width="199">This year's recipient of the Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) Access Community Health Scholarship is Roberta Kaio, from Ahipara in the Far North. </p> 
<p>Roberta is of Ngati Kahu ki Whangaroa and Ngapuhi Nui Tonu descent and works as a Primary Mental Health Coordinator for a mobile nursing team with Te Hiku Hauora. She will use the scholarship funds towards her Masters of Nursing at the University of Auckland.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Roberta is passionate about working in mental health, especially in rural areas, and promotes working in a holistic framework and within a cultural approach.</p> 
<p> “I'm so grateful to receive this scholarship,” says Roberta, who has two post-graduate diplomas in health management and nursing. “I started studying later in life, while on a Single Parent Benefit after a traumatic experience. I remember the days as a single mother with two children, knowing I had to do something better for myself and for my children. I became passionate about supporting people with mental health issues and those that experience abuse.”</p> 
<p>Through study and employment opportunities, Roberta progressed her nursing career working with Auckland DHBs, including Community Mental Health teams, the Mason clinic and non-governmental agencies.</p> 
<p>“After nearly 22 years living in Auckland, my husband, children and I shifted to the Far North to reconnect with our whanau and community, we now have a better life balance with time for fishing, being outdoors gathering kai and time on the beach together.”</p> 
<p>“I spend a lot of time travelling to clients across the rural Far North; however, I get a great deal of satisfaction seeing the work that I do make a difference to the community, and I enjoy being part of people's journey in a positive way.” </p> 
<p>RWNZ and Access are pleased to play a part in helping support Roberta's own journey towards delivering crucial health services to those in rural communities.</p> 
<p>“Community-based rural health services are essential for people living in remote areas,” says Fiona Gower, RWNZ National President. “It is heartening that health professionals like Roberta are passionate about working in regions such as the Far North, and undertaking further study to improve professional knowledge and experience for provision of quality rural health services.”</p> 
<p>Access Chief Executive Officer, Simon Lipscombe says, ”We are delighted to award this scholarship to Roberta, who has demonstrated, through her continual studies, an ongoing commitment to providing essential mental health services to those in her rural community. She represents the important connections between primary and secondary healthcare and what that means to the communities that rely on health providers. We are excited to see how Roberta's career progresses over the years and wish her well.”</p>

 * There was a question in relation to visitors wanting to use E Category firearms in New Zealand. It was conveyed that a directive has been given to look at a workable solution. An FCAF member stated they will provide a high level summary with security measures and options.
</div> 
<div>
 Action Point: Report back on progress of visitors permits by Police
</div> 
<div>
 Item 3 – Arms Trade Treaty update
</div> 
<div>
 Police and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFAT) have completed the second Annual Report on exports and imports of firearms in accordance with the ATT. This can be found on the MFAT website. It was noted that there is work to be done around Police collection of import figures, a work in progress.
</div> 
<div>
 The Brokering (Weapons and Related Items) Controls Bill has started the parliamentary process – it had its first reading in the House on the 15th August and was referred to Select Committee. It will now be after 23rd September 2017 Election before anything further is done and it is some way off becoming an Act. A question was asked about goods that are transhipped? The answer was that this was not brokering and was covered by NZ law on importing and exporting.
</div> 
<div>
 Item 4– Subcommittee firearms storage
</div> 
<div>
 The first meeting has been held and minutes were being circulated to subcommittee members (to date not all members had had the opportunity to review them). The next meeting is to be 15 September 2017.
</div> 
<div>
 Many ideas and issues had been discussed at the first meeting including having an easier document with tidier categories, requirements for E Category safes and best handling and issues around those whose safes had been approved in the past and which were not considered adequate now. There was mention that there was ‘noise’ around couriering of firearms, carriage on ferries and in campervans. The subcommittee will look at security in these situations also.
</div> 
<div>
 A question was asked, should the number of firearms someone has make a difference to the level of security needed to match the level of risk? It was mentioned that Arms Officers have difficulty with measuring thickness and are inconsistent in application of ‘rules’; this requires an easy guide for them to ensure the same standards are applied across New Zealand. Further discussion was had around thickness &lt;6mm vs &gt;6mm. It was suggested that the measure should be based on the product and not only on the thickness. It was asked that if an angle grinder was used to cut them could we work out some measurements to make it much harder or would this just be based on what people felt to be the case?
</div> 
<div>
 It was asked if there were figures on the number of safes not approved now that were in the past. There are no figures on this.

</div> 
<div>
 FIRST MEETING COMPLETED SECOND MEETING 15 SEPTEMBER 2
</div> 
<div>
 Firearm security is always going to be about stopping the opportunistic thief; someone who is ‘targeting’ firearms will have established best times to ‘hit’ and if intent on thief will work out a method regardless. Best to be done in this case is to make it harder for them.
</div> 
<div>
 A member asked why vettors are in some cases rejecting previously approved safes when the policy around safes had not yet been finalised? In the interim – PNHQ will answer any questions regarding any confusion in the application of rules around safes. This may mean that the outcome changes but equally it may not. Police accepts that the application of standards needs clarity and consistency.
</div> 
<div>
 Action Point: Their needs to be identification of what safes are specifically causing the problems and how many. To be done by the Security Sub Committee.
</div> 
<div>
 Item 5 – Changed from Item 9: Police Armoury Statistics
</div> 
<div>
 A sample of statistics for seizures of firearms that were sent to the Police Armoury for examination purposes was circulated for review by members. Other Police seizure statistics cover a wider group of firearms seized with and without warrant and include seized and returned firearms, and those not needed to be examined (although not surrendered firearms).
</div> 
<div>
 A couple of case examples were discussed:
</div> 
<div>
 1. A case where 60 firearms had been purchased in the preceding 12 months and A category parts had been used to construct E Cat firearms. Police asked the supplier if they had become at all suspicious about the purchases, they said no.
</div> 
<div>
 2. Two undercover police officers posed as offering to purchase two fully automatic firearms. The person who was to sell them was charged, although has now got their licence back.
</div> 
<div>
 FCAF member noted that these type of people give the majority of ‘fit and proper’ people a bad name and cause restrictive rules for all.
</div> 
<div>
 Discussion took place on the frequency of Arms Officer visits to dealerships and clubs and that there are differences in each police district.
</div> 
<div>
 There was a discussion around Webley revolvers and post war family inherited firearms that used to be able to be bought without a licence. There are many in the community already and not everyone is likely to have handed these in when the rules changed.
</div> 
<div>
 Action Point: Police to put the options for surrendering ‘grey’ firearms on their website: these are either to hand in at a police station, but phone first or to a Dealer to pass onto Police.
</div> 
<div>
 There was a question asking if ‘pistols’ in Police armoury seizure statistics included sawn off firearms that are under 762mm. The Police response was that in all likelihood the firearms would be entered as sawn offs, not pistols. It was stated that there is an issue if ‘sawn offs are being classified as pistols.
</div> 
<div>
 MSSAs were also discussed. Police pointed out that A Cat firearms seized with high capacity mags were automatically MSSAs, although there are other MSSA features such as pistol grips, flash suppressor etc. Police reaffirmed that firearms are classified as they are seized.
</div> 
<div>
 Action Point: Can Police supply the figures for seizures of firearms without warrant under section 18 of the Search and Surveillance Act. Police.
</div> 
<div>
 3
</div> 
<div>
 Discussion was had that it is useful to look at the percentage of MSSAs seized compared to what is ‘out there’. Some committee members felt that MSSAs are under scrutiny at present due to high profile incidents (recent Whangarei homicide and Morrinsville shooting). Police confirmed they supplied data to Select Committee on previous years data. A question was asked regarding how many are smuggled over the border. Simple answer is it is impossible to know. Customs is happy to receive any information that will help target this type of smuggling. There is always potential, however, it is likely there would be more evidence of illegal importation if this was more prolific. The borders are also monitored by MPI (physical searches) and Police.
</div> 
<div>
 Shared a challenge: FCAF members were invited to consider a couple of examples of firearms that Police has concerns over. The question was should these be accepted? This was a positive opportunity to share knowledge and thoughts on firearms and for FCAF to see the issues police face.
</div> 
<div>
 Item 6 (was item 5) – Arms Act Service Delivery Group
</div> 
<div>
 The change of name for the group that includes a number of workstreams relating to the management of firearms-related issues is to emphasise that it is customer focused. It will include work toward a centralised permit hub and business improvements.
</div> 
<div>
 Item 7 – TradeMe
</div> 
<div>
 Police has been working with TradeMe to improve the process for establishing the licencing process of those purchasing firearms on TradeMe.
</div> 
<div>
 TradeMe has completed an update to advise that all persons wishing to ask a question, bid or purchase a firearm will be asked for the name and number on their firearms licence. This will be the subject of a query to Police to search on the Police database for confirmation that the information TradeMe has is correct. Only a Yes or No answer will be received so information (other than licence currency) will be withheld.
</div> 
<div>
 Police would like to see this taken up by other online sellers of firearms.
</div> 
<div>
 Item 7b – Social Media and Organisation View
</div> 
<div>
 Police will not comment on what is in social media as it is often unbalanced.
</div> 
<div>
 We will educate and inform people by putting more information on the Police website and encourage people to ask questions.
</div> 
<div>
 Item 8 – Opportunities for AGMs or Similar
</div> 
<div>
 Police has undertaken to attend AGMs of firearms organisations and similar if invited. Mike McIlraith will attend Pistol NZ AGM on 23 September 2017.
</div> 
<div>
 Item 9 dealt with as Item 5
</div> 
<div>
 Item 10 – MSSA Parts Importation
</div> 
<div>
 Police need to look at importation of parts from several perspectives.
</div> 
<div>
 Comment from a committee member was if I am a fit and proper person and I say I am importing parts for A Cat, should that not be trusted? If not this could be a subjectively based view on what ‘might’ happen. There is a lack of trust and it is very confusing. The firearms community needs
</div> 
<div>
 4
</div> 
<div>
 consistent and timely permitting, based on accepting the stated intention of fit and proper persons to sell parts they wish to import as A Cat parts.
</div> 
<div>
 Someone remembered a Police Legal Opinion (maybe 2005).
</div> 
<div>
 Action Point: Police to follow up whether there has been previous legal advice sought.
</div> 
<div>
 Police position is to look at each import application on its merits. There is an issue with not knowing how parts will be used (intention).
</div> 
<div>
 MSSA controls were about ensuring safety and that these firearms were in the hands of fit and proper people. A comment suggested that Police should have no involvement (in import of A Cat parts) and it was Customs that should be involved when the items come in. Further comment was that the market has changed significantly and so has technology.
</div> 
<div>
 High capacity magazines require no licence to purchase in NZ. This is significant when it comes to people assembling MSSAs and attempts have been made to try and control these. A committee member commented that they should be restricted.
</div> 
<div>
 Someone asked “why are we talking about permits for parts that do not require permits at the moment?” FCAF could come up with a solution. It could mean better education. There are currently three firearms manufacturers in NZ.
</div> 
<div>
 The onus should rest squarely with the firearms user to ensure they comply with the current law and get correct information.
</div> 
<div>
 A committee member stated that the continuous shift of police personnel makes consistency very difficult. This area needs someone who has in-depth knowledge and stays. Police commented that this is the reason there is investment in ASAC project, which will include career roles. The Police Executive have recognised this area needs investment. Looking at a centralised management Hub of vetting with validation through District Arms Officers. Currently things look like they always have but the Police are looking at a number of potential changes. One possibility is that there could be graduated applicant tiers, with new licence applicants having greater scrutiny while current licence holders have a streamlined process when they renew their licence. The project is a huge undertaking and will likely take longer than we would all like. Police note that processes will work better when firearms users bring issues to Police attention. Such as when the licence number was visible in the clear view panel on the envelopes sent out. This was fixed on the same day it was brought to police attention. We will continue working together jointly to fix things.
</div> 
<div>
 Item 11 – Training Provider RFP
</div>

 Police has extended the current training providers to 30 June 2018 in order to sort firearms training properly rather than rushing into a RFP. It was acknowledged that it is a complex area and personnel new to the role are doing their best to come up to speed and learn the ropes. Discussion and meetings are welcome.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. Send the permit form link in Minutes. Completed. </p> 
<p>12. Police to send information to Forum members covered in letter to Taylor. Completed.</p> 
<p> 13. Police to investigate the use of the term ‘Biographies’ by Arms Officers. Completed. There was some discussion on the last action point. It was noted that ‘Biographies’ is a term used by some Arms Officers relating to the requirement for detailed information in an application for importing a firearm for special reason from firearms dealers, importers and collectors. There have been a couple of instances where an Arms Officers wanted a Biography for a one-off importation; however, this is unusual. It was noted that Biographies is an incorrect term and should be more correctly described as Supporting Information for an application. A message has gone to Arms Officers to this effect. The Chair altered the original agenda so that items 5 and 6 were bumped up ahead of item 3 to fit with Supt Chris Cahill’s availability. </p> 
<p>Item 5 – Arms Safety and Control Project Police is currently focusing on completing 3 ICT changes for the National Intelligence Application (NIA). In the meantime, critical issues in the business as usual (BAU) space need care and attention. Police wants any changes to be built on a solid foundation to prevent further systemic problems arising in the BAU. Police is devising possible short, medium and long term solutions. Police wants to make sure that its base supports future solutions. Both Police National Headquarters and Police Districts have been consulted on this issue. On the whole, Police is confident that it is getting a clearer picture of what changes are required in NIA. Preliminary thinking is to have centralised control over the permit system. This has not yet been decided. In the meantime the Project will concentrate on support for the current permit process in the first instance. A member inquired about what needs to happen before Police receives the ‘go ahead’, and that it is important to build a more comprehensive picture as soon as possible. Police advised that it could consider making a one-off bid from the Justice Sector fund. Another member advised that not everyone would be comfortable or able to use a computer-based system, and entering on line at a Police station or similar could be problematic as required information may not be readily available. While they may be a small proportion of the population they needed to be provided for. A member suggested there needed to be some rural proofing in any new system. Police acknowledged that there is not a lot more it can do to help with this issue, but noted that some electronic changes may make it easier as it will minimise the personal contact required and limit the paper-based demands. With this in mind, the Chair emphasised that the Arms Safety and Control project has short, medium and long term elements. </p> 
<p>2 A member outlined that issues with permits and applications have improved considerably, and that they were very impressed with the turnaround – people who suffer from geographical constraints are often met with very accommodating Arms Officers. Another member outlined that rural proofing can be quite difficult, and that applications sometimes must be completed twice. It was suggested that if the application process was done at a local level perhaps this will be less of an issue. With this in mind, the member indicated that a local centralised system should be considered as part of any long term plan. It was noted that Police is confident that there is no outstanding permit application held in PNHQ greater than 30 days but recognises that there may still be some permits in Districts not yet entered into the system and some permits issued from PNHQ that have not yet reached the applicant. As advised to representatives of the Wairarapa Pistol and Shooting Sports Club, Police is advising people who have been waiting for more than 40 days to contact PNHQ and to use the email address <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4535372a2f2026316b232c37202437283605352a292c26206b222a33316b2b3f6b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> Police noted that based on information from the Districts, a backlog may be looming. Consequently, it is working towards a proactive system. Police wants to be ahead of the game and able to predict demand so that it can coordinate and manage responses effectively. In relation to the Law and Order Committee’s Inquiry, one member asked whether Police considered the scope of the Arms Safety and Control project capable of covering all of the Committee’s recommendations. Specifically, the member asked whether it would be capable of handling the Committee’s pseudo-registration recommendation (this may have been referring to either the voluntary recording of serial numbers or to the proposed permit to procure for A cats recommended by the Committee). </p> 
<p>Police noted that while the serial number of A category firearms it is an additional field in the data field, it should be able to add this to its capability. A member noted that previously there had been some discussion on Arms Officers being appointed by Police National Headquarters, and asked whether this has been rejected or followed. Police outlined that there has not yet been a decision on that point. Currently Police is more concerned about whether there are enough Arms Officers currently available to provide a good service, but indicated that it will look into this proposal at a later stage. Police is working towards the consistent application of existing standards. </p> 
<p>Training at the Police College organised by Response and Operations is the first step in this process, and recently took place. It was designed to outline the requirements for the Arms Officer job. Police captured just under half the country’s Arms Officers. Another course is scheduled for next year, and it is hoped that Arms Officers will be able to attend an annual refresher course. Police is also hoping to give arms training to arms licensing staff. Police is confident that Arms Officers have a good understanding of what is going on, including the Arms Safety and Control project. Police advised that Nicholas Taylor was invited to attend the course (and did so), so that he could understand how everything runs from Police’s side. </p> 
<p>Item 6 – Select Committee – Inquiry into issues relating to the illegal possession of firearms The Law and Order Committee published its final report on 7 April 2017 on the Parliamentary website, and it was sent out to members along with the agenda for this meeting. The Committee made 20 recommendations, which the government will then consider and provide a response to be tabled in Parliament within 60 working days. Police notes that if the government wishes to proceed with any of the recommendations, it will need to go through the full normal processes required to change legislation or regulations. 3 One of the Committee’s recommendations related to the introduction of Firearms Prohibition Orders (FPOs). FPOS are based on the Australian FPO regime. Basically, they prevent specified people from accessing firearms, but also ensure that they cannot reside or be in a place that stores firearms. They are also unable to use a firearm under the supervision of a firearms licence holder. Breaching a FPO would also carry a significant penalty. Police commented that it is very unlikely that firearms legislation and regulations will change before the election and that the government’s response could well suggest that more work needs to be done. A member noted that the Inquiry specifically related to the illegal possession of firearms and that its terms of reference related to how unlicensed persons come into possession of firearms. The member considered the recommendations in the report did not seem to focus on the purpose of the Inquiry. Police commented that the Committee could not fully understand how unlicensed persons come into the possession of firearms illegally because of a lack of data – the methodology from Sir Thomas Thorp’s 1997 report can only take you so far. The Committee had very little hard information on this matter and Police data has limitations. With this in mind, the member suggested that the recommendations were predominantly based on information that the Committee did not know. In particular, the member was concerned that there was going to be firearms “registration by stealth” as a result (referring to police recording the serial numbers of firearms when renewing someone’s firearms licence). They also noted the issues with data integrity. Police outlined that firearms registration involves firearms owners voluntarily giving Police a number of firearm details, including the serial number, of all their firearms. Over the years Police has not recommended universal registration of firearms. Police sees benefit in collecting better information over time but sees limited benefit in trying to register all firearms that may be in legal ownership at a single point in time. In that regard Police’s view is consistent with that of the government. </p> 
<p>In relation to the so called ‘secret submission’ it was explained that Police, having been invited to be advisers to the Committee, was bound by the parliamentary process and parliamentary privilege. – this is fully described in Standing Orders of Parliament that is publicly available. The Committee’s deliberations were subject to parliamentary privilege, so neither Police nor Members of Parliament could comment on the Committee’s discussions until their report was tabled, at which point the Police advice and any other advice requested by the Committee became public. This is a long established practice and is one of the strengths of the Westminster parliamentary process. A member noted that firearms owners are not happy with some of the Committee’s recommendations – particularly over the sale and supply of firearms. The member also stated that he and others were disappointed in some incorrect statements that were made on Breakfast by the President of the Police Association. The member went on to say that everyone in the firearms community is worried about a lack of trust of Police, and that this probably originated with the pistol grip fiasco in 2009. Firearms owners are also worried about additional compliance obligations. Finally, the member stipulated that some of the recommendations were not necessarily made to help lawful firearms owners, but burden them. Another member noted that they have looked at similar recommendations in the past which looked more like job creation schemes. With this in mind, the member stated that since 1843 there have been hundreds of changes, but that the system will not succeed if firearms owners do not buy into 4 it. </p> 
<p>For this reason, they suggested that it may be wise to start a new system and include firearm users during the policy development process. Police noted that it receives a number of different messages from the firearms community. The general ‘fit and proper person’ approach works well, but policy changes may be required in a number of other areas. One member noted that the current system works well, but that it would be useful to tighten aspects of the system to make sure it works consistently across the board. Another member discussed the recommendation for a new category of firearms licences for certain semi-automatics to replace the current MSSA category. It was alarming that a modified shotgun for duck hunters and .22 calibre semi-automatics (probably New Zealand’s biggest selling firearm) could fall under this criteria. The member insisted that if these firearms fell under a newly prohibited classification, there would be a surge in grey firearms. Police sympathised but outlined that the ability to convert certain A category firearms into semi-automatic weapons is becoming more and more of an issue. A member expressed concern that that semi-automatic A cats may be required to adhere to more stringent and more expensive storage requirements. This is significant, especially for someone who lives in an apartment block – how would they build a strong room in that situation? It was thought that people will just ignore the requirements and leave their firearms in the present storage arrangements. It seems easy in principle, but it is often very difficult to comply with stronger regulations. Another member noted that they agreed with three of the Committee’s recommendations, but did not list them. Further, they would be interested in working with Police on what should change. Other members agreed that it would be advantageous to discuss possible changes with Police in a formal setting. Members agreed that it would be useful to form a Subcommittee on the Select Committee’s recommendations. Police agreed to using the Subcommittee on a consultative basis to inform the advice it put through to the Minister. Police noted that any changes to regulations and/or legislation would require consultation, and this includes consultation with both sides – not just firearms owners and their representatives. There have been a significant number of Official Information Act requests relating to the seizure of firearms (roughly about 70-90 seizures per month). Based on annual figures, Police believes that approximately 10 restricted firearms are seized each month. One member asked if these were truly restricted firearms as many people could not distinguish MSSAs from A cat semi-automatics. Possible action point –Police to provide the Forum with more detailed information on the types of restricted firearms seized by the Police, noting that this information would be limited to what is known at the Wellington armoury and would not provide a comprehensive national picture of restricted firearms seized A member noted that all restricted firearms are registered, and enquired about how that would affect statistics. Police noted that when seizing firearms, police do not always enter specific firearm details, such as the type of firearm. For example, it might note that it is a restricted firearm, but officers will not necessarily specify that it is a pistol, a MSSA or whether it is a converted/modified firearm. </p> 
<p>The member also suggested that Police should be capable of providing data on where firearms come from, at least in relation to firearms that were originally restricted (not converted into a restricted firearm). Police stated that this is a key part of the Arms Safety and Control project. With some changes, seizure data may become more comprehensive, and data quality is likely to 5 improve. The member then indicated that it would be very beneficial for seized military-style semiautomatics and restricted firearms to be given back to their lawful owner and that data should be kept on this. Noting time constraints and the availability of some members, the Chair stopped these discussions for the time being to ensure that item 3 – the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) update could take place Item 3 – Arms Trade Treaty Update It was noted that there have not been any major developments in relation to the ATT since December. Police and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFAT) are working on the ATT report on the import and export of weapons1 . </p> 
<p>The Brokering Bill is still being drafted, but there is no indicative timeframe on when it will start the parliamentary process – this depends on Cabinet decision making. However, work is actively being done on it. The Notification of exempted sporting firearms export form has been working well, and MFAT has been receiving a lot of notifications. International import certificates are now used around the world – they have universal meaning. You need the right authority to import controlled goods, like firearms or their component parts. A member noted that it is not ‘kosher’ to use the word ‘weapon’ during a firearms forum, as it carries negative connotations and paints members and firearms in an unfair light. The presenter noted that their work involves weapons and the ATT relates to weapons, including firearms. However, they also said that they would take this on board in the future. The presenter outlined that MFAT would keep the forum in the loop regarding the Brokering Bill, and New Zealand’s ATT.</p> 
<p> Item 6 resumed – Select Committee – Inquiry into issues relating to the illegal possession of firearms The forum decided that it would be useful to create a Subcommittee, including three representatives from Police and four members from the forum to work together and discuss the Committee’s recommendations. Police supported the formation of a Subcommittee to go through the pros and cons of the recommendations. Police noted that there was no guarantee that any conclusions reached by the sub-committee would be supported by Government. It was agreed that the Subcommittee should meet on Wednesday, 3 May (one-off meeting) and would be run as a workshop. The Committee elected four members of the Forum, including: • Nicole McKee • John Herbert • Andrew Edgcombe • Debbie Wakker [Nicole McKee was later appointed as an independent advisor to the Minister of Police on the Select Committee report. Nicole nominated Trevor Dyke as a substitute. Trent Smith was also nominated] 1 MFAT uses the term weapon in the context of the Arms Trade Treaty 6 A member discussed the classification of seized firearms and proposed a long term solution. The member outlined that it would be advantageous to differentiate between different firearm categories. For example, pistols used in crimes are not necessarily the registered pistols that each lawful pistol owner uses – the category includes modified firearms that later fall under the pistol category. </p> 
<p>The member suggested that if this point is clarified, Police may be able to compile more meaningful statistics. Police noted that there will be a transition period where it will need to refine data. There will be a period where it goes through the data and notes where changes should be made. If there are any questions on the Arms Safety and Control project, they should be emailed to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="88f8fae7e2edebfca6eee1faede9fae5fbc8f8e7e4e1ebeda6efe7fefca6e6f2a6">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> Another member suggested that it might be best for local Arms Officers to enter the details of seized firearms into the database, and that this may improve data quality. Police said that it is dedicated to enhancing data quality, and will be as accurate as possible in the future. However, Police also noted that serial numbers are often removed, so Police cannot always tell who the legal owners were. </p> 
<p>Item 4– Subcommittee firearms storage The members had been provided with the Subcommittee’s terms of reference before the meeting took place. It was agreed that the Subcommittee would be represented by three forum members and three Police representatives, with the Chair shared between members of the Subcommittee. While the group is to be restricted to these six people, an agreed subject matter expert could also join the group for certain discussions. In terms of decision making, the Subcommittee’s powers would not exceed the forums. It was confirmed that the Subcommittee is there to ensure that what is being proposed is achievable for ordinary licensed firearms owners. The Committee agreed to the following representatives: • New Zealand Retail (Trent Smith) • Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (Michael Dowling) • Rural Women New Zealand (Rachael Dean) • Police (Insp Roly Williams, Paul Gatland and Richard Smith) One member noted that there are many ways of being secure, and indicated that the price and quality of containers is perhaps not as important as the combination of measures including monitoring alarms. Similar concerns were raised in the Wairarapa meeting mentioned earlier in the Minutes. Police agrees that this is worth considering. A member asked whether the Subcommittee is also going to look at the legal requirements and how they are working. They were concerned that very little has changed in this space for a long time. Police noted that it first needs to validate the current process, and then it can go on to look at changes/recommendations. Firearms prohibition orders (FPOs) 7 FPOs are likely to be one of the amendments to legislation that would progress. The Committee’s recommendation about gang members not being fit and proper links to FPOs. If the amendment goes ahead, it is likely that a limited number of people will be subject to it initially. It is also important to note that FPOs may not just be limited to gang members. Other than those relating to FPO/gang related matters, Police considers any further changes are unlikely before the election. FPOs prohibit someone from obtaining a firearms licence, possessing a firearm and associating with people in possession of firearms. A member raised concerns about this – could a licensed firearms owner be penalised for associating with someone subject to a FPO? Police reconfirmed that relatively few people would be subject to FPOs and considers it extremely unlikely that a licensed firearms owner would befriend someone subject to a FPO. </p> 
<p>Police is still leading work on FPOs, although it will need to go through the Ministry of Justice and the normal parliamentary process before it is included in legislation and implemented. In relation to gang membership, Police has to provide evidence that someone is in a gang. Police has intelligence on patched members and some prospects on their way to becoming patched members. A member asked what the advantages were of having FPOs, compared to someone not being granted a firearms licence. Police outlined that without a licence someone can still use a firearm under the supervision of a firearms licence holder. A lot of ideas in respect of FPOs are being taken from Australia. In New Zealand, FPOs are being predominantly looked at as part of the Gang Action Plan. Interestingly, there is already evidence from Australia that it is much more difficult for someone to take on a leadership role in a gang if they are subject to a FPO. Penalties for firearms offences A member asked about whether it was possible to impose instant fines for firearms offences in New Zealand, rather than full prosecution. The member indicated that this might be a good alternative option – there is a better closeness to the offence with an instant fine, whereas a long and drawn out court process is not as good. The member indicated that there is an unhelpful disconnect between an offence which is committed now, and the court process which takes place a lot longer down the track. Police outlined that there is no provision for officers to impose fines for firearms offences. Nevertheless, Police noted that under a new Arms Amendment Bill, the whole penalty structure would be reviewed. During this review, there may potentially be scope to provide for some offences to be punishable by infringement fees.</p> 
<p> Item 8 – Representatives’ attendance at Forum involved in litigation with Police The Chair noted that the primary aim of the Firearms Community Advisory Forum is for members to establish open lines of communication, and for members to be confident that their comments will not be attributed to the other members outside of the meeting. If it gets to the situation where a number of members take legal action against Police, then the confidentiality ordinarily guaranteed under the Chatham House Rules may no longer apply. If a case went to court, a member may need to testify under oath and could be forced to identify and repeat the comments made by individuals at the forum. Police noted that if the Forum is to work, there needs to be a robust process in place for free and frank flow of discussion – it is essential to lay down some basic rules. With this in mind, it might be worth taking up one of two options: 8 1. When a topic comes up that touches on a member’s litigation, it may be prudent for them to leave the room during discussion of that particular topic. 2. The member could delegate their authority to someone else within their organisation to attend the meeting instead. For either of these options to work, members need to be quite clear about their position/situation from the beginning, and it needs to be quite clear when a specific topic is going to be discussed in the meeting. A member suggested that judicial review is different from an individual’s own decision to litigate – if judicial review is underway, then contributing to the ongoing conversation may not be as problematic but time will tell. The Committee agreed to adopt the rules as described.</p> 
<p> Item 9 – Firearms Safety Council of Aotearoa The proposed membership in the Forum of Jo Green as a representative of the Firearms Safety Council of Aotearoa (FSCofA) had been tabled at the Arms Safety and Control project workshop in February, but no formal decision taken. The Committee was advised that an email had been sent to FSCofA which noted criteria for consideration of membership which are: • Relevant skills, knowledge and understanding of firearms and issues/legislation relating to firearms • Relevant practical experience and networks within the firearms community • Personal attributes and ability to work constructively with and make a contribution to the Forum different from that provided by current membership • Being a representative of an incorporated group (who can represent the views of the group rather than their individual view). That email acknowledged that some of the required information had been provided and that Joe Green’s personal knowledge and experience is well known, but the applicant was asked for: • the list of organisations that are members, and an indication of membership size, • what aspects of the Council’s objectives distinguish the Council from the firearm safety and safe use representatives already on the Committee; and • an indication if the AGM has been held or if you remain in an interim chair role. A member provided some additional information around membership of FSCofA, and the Forum membership agreed in-principle (by majority), to the FSCofA membership subject to receipt of adequate additional information from them. </p> 
<p>Item 10 – Other Business A member raised a concern about the number of roadblocks that some Australian visitors had to go through in order to participate in a firearms event that took place over Easter weekend. At first, they were not licensed to use restricted firearms because they did not have the equivalent endorsement in Australia. The issue is that civilians cannot lawfully own those firearms in Australia, so there was no way for them to obtain an equivalent endorsement there. Police noted that this issue was resolved quickly. There were processes that could be put in place to address risks. Nevertheless, Police noted that it may be useful to clarify policy on this issue. Police indicated that it requires 30 days minimum to complete the visitor licensing process. 9 The member then asked what would happen if a citizen from the United States of America wanted to come over and use firearms – a country without firearm categories. Police replied that it would make inquiries and ensure that the visitor had a certificate from the relevant law enforcement agency in the United States showing that they have authority to possess the firearm in question. The member indicated that the recent Australian situation should have been a very low risk for Police – the competition was taking place on a fully controlled range on a military base, with secure firearms storage facilities. Police noted that according to New Zealand’s firearms legislation, a person must have an E Category licence, even if they are shooting under appropriate supervision. Police cannot provide authority for someone to obtain E category firearms without the correct endorsement. The member stated that this has not been a problem over the past decade, but it appears to be at the moment because of a change in policy. Police noted there was no change in policy. Visitors need to be properly identified to determine eligibility. Anyone applying for a visitor’s firearms licence should have a good chance of getting it. They just need to provide Police with the right details, including a copy of their current licence. It is important for Police to have appropriate checks and balances in place. Police noted that it will seek to provide greater transparency of process, and will note flagged issues. The member suggested that when firearms licensing is carried out for sporting teams it should be conducted in a centralised fashion. The Chair noted that it is important for both sides of the debate to recognise the difficult decisions that need to be made, and that it is imperative to have a transparent process in place. Another member suggested that the meeting was particularly productive on this occasion, and that it may be because there was some continuity from the Arms Safety and Control workshop that took place in February (full day workshop). With that in mind, they suggested that at least one Forum meeting each year should be in the form of an all-day session. The benefit of this is that nothing would be rushed. Police agreed to this. </p>

 MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE – ARMS TRADE TREATY UPDATE
</div> 
<div>
 MFAT provided a background and overview of the ATT and New Zealand’s reporting requirements.
</div> 
<div>
 The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is the first treaty to regulate the international transfer of conventional arms, from handguns, to tanks, to battleships. It entered into force on 24 December 2014. The ATT focuses on strengthening import and export legislation, policies and processes, and increasing transparency around arms transfers. The ATT now has nearly 100 signatories. The next (third) meeting is to be held in Geneva 11 – 14 September 2017.The submission of States Parties’ first annual reports, which will be publicly available, is a major milestone.
</div> 
<div>
 NZ provided an initial report and subsequent yearly reports are a requirement. 1
</div> 
<div>
 The Civil Society criticised the ATT for not addressing the most significant issues, such as transfer of arms to Saudi Arabia (Yemen). However, the first two years has concentrated on gaining signatories and attending to procedural frameworks and ‘housekeeping’ to ensure a good structural base from which to focus on furtherance of the ATT. ‘Housekeeping’ has included setting consistent templates and setting up a voluntary trust fund to help countries that are struggling to meet ATT criteria. New Zealand has provided ‘workshops’ on barriers for Africa which has no legislative framework to enable them to meet the ATT requirements.
</div> 
<div>
 A question was put to MFAT about whether China and Russia are signatories to the ATT. They are not, but have said they will be keeping a watching brief and reviewing their position. India is not a signatory. The USA has signed the ATT but has not ratified it due to the Senate rules. The UK and France have signed and ratified the ATT, while Israel has signed but is yet to ratify the Treaty.
</div> 
<div>
 There are a number of important developments relating to the ATT this year, including:
</div> 
<div>
 1. The creation of three working groups looking at Transparency and Reporting, Implementation and Universalisation;
</div> 
<div>
 2. The establishment of a voluntary trust to help states overcome barriers to join the ATT;
</div> 
<div>
 3. A set of Governing criteria; and
</div> 
<div>
 4. The appointment of the first head of the Secretariat for a four year term.
</div> 
<div>
 ATT and Brokering
</div> 
<div>
 New Zealand currently has no controls on brokering, which is the negotiation, arrangement or facilitation of a transaction involving the international movement of arms and/or military equipment.
</div> 
<div>
 Article 10 of the ATT requires each state party to take measures, pursuant to its national laws, to regulate brokering under its jurisdiction for conventional arms covered under Article 2(1). Such measures may include requiring brokers to register or obtain written authorisation before engaging in brokering. Unregulated brokering can undermine the Treaty.
</div> 
<div>
 In directing that New Zealand should ratify the UN Arms Trade Treaty, Cabinet also directed officials to develop proposals to address brokering. The proposed Bill will establish a regime that prevents New Zealand individuals and entities from engaging in brokering where there is a risk of arms and/or military equipment being transferred to illegitimate users or undesirable destinations.
</div> 
<div>
 This will be achieved by requiring individuals and entities wanting to engage in brokering to register with the New Zealand Government and obtain a permit for brokering activities. Permits would not be granted where there is a risk of the movement of arms and military equipment to illegitimate users or destinations. Brokering without a permit would be an offence. The regime would have extraterritorial effect and apply not only to persons in New Zealand, but also New Zealanders and New Zealand entities operating abroad.
</div> 
<div>
 The Brokering Bill is currently being drafted.
</div> 
<div>
 The ATT covers all weapons on New Zealand’s Strategic Goods List. It is important to note that the Treaty does not cover imports, and exports to and from New Zealand and the domestic sale of firearms in New Zealand, as these activities are already covered by the Arms Act 1983 and MFAT processes.
</div> 
<div>
 A member queried what a “transaction” is for the purposes of the proposed brokering legislation. MFAT responded that the definition is unclear at the moment and that it will be clarified in law, although they mentioned that transactions would relate to items on the Strategic Goods List as shown on the website. Each country has scope to define “brokering” themselves. 2
</div> 
<div>
 It was noted that it is unclear where the Bill will fit in the 2017 Legislative Programme. The Bill’s expected progress will be outlined at the start of next year, but unforeseen events may throw this into disarray. However, this Bill is expected to have cross-party support, which may help its progress.
</div> 
<div>
 MFAT noted that the ATT and its corresponding Bill should have no practical impact on New Zealand. The key point is that New Zealand has to make sure that it is not the weak link among the countries ratifying the Treaty. Nevertheless, a member raised a concern that the Bill may result in increased import costs.
</div> 
<div>
 ARMS SAFETY AND CONTROL PROJECT
</div> 
<div>
 Police gave a presentation on the Arms Safety and Control (ASAC) project. Police provided a very brief overview of what was discussed at the previous meeting. Before discussing the project in detail, Police noted that the project’s name had changed from the ‘Firearms Administration and Management’ project at the previous meeting to ASAC. A copy of the slideshow presentation has been sent to all Forum members.
</div> 
<div>
 The project has identified three key issues, including resourcing, effective management of firearm licensing and the Arms Act keeping pace with the changing environment. These issues have corresponding risks to be managed, including feelings of community safety, inconsistent support to the firearms community and Police not managing the firearms environment effectively. In relation to the risks, Police outlined how it wants to provide more consistent support for the firearms community.
</div> 
<div>
 Police listed the following goals:
</div> 
<div>
 1. Reduce the opportunities for harm from firearms
</div> 
<div>
 2. Improve user and stakeholder satisfaction with firearms management practice
</div> 
<div>
 3. Create a trusted firearms management system.
</div> 
<div>
 There were also a number of critical success factors including strategic fit, potential value for money (whether the market can sustain it), supplier capacity, and potential affordability and achievability.
</div> 
<div>
 Police also offered a likely framework (boundaries to work within) for the project:
</div> 
<div>
 1. Scope – Police seeks to effectively deliver services that address the needs of the firearms community and firearms environment
</div> 
<div>
 2. Service solution option – Police will implement a new national system to meet the needs of the firearms environment
</div> 
<div>
 3. Service delivery – Police (internal) or Police with other providers may deliver the services
</div> 
<div>
 4. Implementation – Police will deliver these services with a staged approach
</div> 
<div>
 5. Funding – Current funding, increased fees and potentially greater Crown funding will provide the revenue required.
</div> 
<div>
 A member asked whether a new ICT solution would impact on funding. Police advised that it would not necessarily have an impact, and that it is possible that funding will be entirely internal. Noting this, another member raised a concern that greater overheads would require more funding, and fees should not necessarily be increased.
</div> 
<div>
 Police also noted that it is hoping to complete the business case by the second quarter in 2017. However, it will require approval after June., In early 2017 (date to be confirmed), Police will hold a workshop for community members of the Forum in the hope of understanding the firearms community’s needs, and align them with wider organisational outcomes where possible.
</div> 
<div>
 An email has been set up specifically for information around the firearms change project. Anyone with concerns or questions regarding the Police project should email:

</div> 
<div>
 POLICE ENGAGE SAFETY CAMPAIGN
</div> 
<div>
 Police then discussed its firearms safety campaign, noting that it was previously unable to access its target market with its $90,000 budget. Police talked to its public affairs team and analysed how to improve its message and access more people. Police has now coordinated an advertising campaign with Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which will play advertisements across a number of different platforms (namely radio and internet) at important times of the year. This strategy keeps costs down whilst also hitting the target market. The campaign includes strong themes of storage, handling, shooting and transport of firearms. It will be run under the banner “engage Safety”. The current Storage advertisement states “If it is not in a safe, it is not safe”.
</div> 
<div>
 The advertisements were shown to the members, who largely agreed that the messages were simple, focused and effective. A number of members advised that they were happy to work with Police on the advertising campaign.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 CHAMBER SAFETY TAGS
</div> 
<div>
 There was some discussion about firearms tags and that they used to be given out by the Mountain Safety Council. It was noted by a member of the Forum that there is a manufacturer in Taita who can produce these for about 69 cents per unit. Together, Police and this member are to investigative this further and report back at the next meeting.
</div> 
<div>
 There was also some discussion on the safety of shooting sports. Some members suggested that the firearms safety advertising should be targeted more towards hunters than shooters generally.
</div> 
<div>
 PERMITS
</div> 
<div>
 Police noted that it has received an influx of letters on permits recently, however this does not reflect the general situation. Most districts have minimal or no import permits backlogged. There was a major backlog at the end of 2015 but now there is a 30 day turnaround. There are 250 import permit applications for parts waiting to be processed, although this is purely because of IT issues.
</div> 
<div>
 The permit application system is essentially electronic. Once it is printed on watermarked paper, it should go to the Arms Officer and the applicant. There is no way of tracing that at the moment. Once printed, it goes to Police and then to the applicant. There is an issue where Police thinks that it has done its job, but the hard copy of the permit may not have been received by the applicant. The way around this is to send email advice that a permit has been forwarded.
</div> 
<div>
 SUBCOMMITTEE – FIREARMS SECURITY
</div> 
<div>
 A Forum member provided a written proposal that there should be a subcommittee on firearms security and storage to further inform the review of security arrangements. The member was not present at the meeting, but a number of members agreed that they were interested in joining the subcommittee as the concept of security has changed. Another member indicated that they would not necessarily like to be a part of the subcommittee, but that they would like any proposal run by them to ensure it is rural-proofed. Police will draft Terms of Reference for the subcommittee in the New Year.
</div> 
<div>

</div> 
<div>
 SELECT COMMITTEE INQUIRY
</div> 
<div>
 The Law and Order Committee conducting the Inquiry into the Illegal Possession of Firearms has drafted their report. Police has provided comment and has attended a number of meetings. The timeframe for the release of the Committee’s Report will likely be March or April 2017.
</div> 
<div>
 FIREARMS LEGISLATION
</div> 
<div>
 The former Minister of Police has advised officials there will be no movement on the Arms Act until after the Select Committee release their report.
</div> 
<div>
 OTHER BUSINESS:
</div> 
<div>
 Forum members expressed their concern that changes being made by Police are piecemeal and not coordinated. Some members are concerned that members of their own organisations are losing trust and confidence in Police, so it is crucial to establish better lines of communication. Police noted that this is one of the key reasons behind the consultation and workshop scheduled in early 2017, as it will ensure that stakeholders can contribute to the review process.
</div> 
<div>
 A member indicated that there was a fear in their organisation that if someone speaks up, they will be earmarked for lesser service in the future. Police outlined that there is more of a dialogue between Police and the firearms community than there has been in the past, and that if people are experiencing issues, they should contact their Arms Officer. If the Arms Officer does not know how to help, the Arms Officer can contact Police National Headquarters. Contact information for Arms Officers can be found at:
</div> 
<div>
 http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/firearms-and-safety/firearms-offices-and-contact-details
</div> 
<div>
 There was also comment regarding a previous Arms Manager who spent significant time with the firearms community understanding what their requirements were and why, and worked hard to establish a good relationship with them, which included fair policies and procedures. An invitation was put to the new Arms Manager to attend firearms meetings and other events.
</div> 
<div>
 One forum member suggested that all Arms Officers should report through PNHQ Wellington as there was a significant amount of inconsistency in the application of policy, often to the detriment of the firearms community.
</div> 
<div>
 MEASUREMENT OF FIREARMS
</div> 
<div>
 There was a lengthy discussion on the fact that the measurement of MSSAs has changed. Consequently, some licensed firearms owners no longer lawfully own their firearms because they do not hold the required handgun endorsement. This is fundamentally because some shortened MSSAs are now defined as pistols because of their length.
</div> 
<div>
 Police noted that a document has been made available that covers the measurement of firearms (link attached). Based on this opinion, Police advises that if a firearm (when folded) is less than 762mm and can still be fired, then it is classed as a pistol under the Arms Act 1983. This interpretation is considered to be based on the intention of the Act when it was drafted.
</div> 
<div>
 Police has agreed to look into getting a further legal view on this.
</div> 
<div>
 PERMITS
</div> 
<div>
 A question was put forward “what would delay a permit for a ‘standard’ part for an E Cat firearm”?
</div> 
<div>
 Police responded that that there are essentially two things that can produce delays:
</div> 
<div>
 5
</div> 
<div>
 1. Staffing and training (new staff and the time it takes to train them)
</div> 
<div>
 2. IT systems, the current one is standalone and can only be used by one person to input data at a time.
</div> 
<div>
 It was mentioned that a template for permits is online and could speed the process up if more people used it. The link is attached:
</div> 
<div>
 Link to templates online????
</div> 
<div>
 It was suggested, and Police agreed, to add a section on permit numbers (including applications still being processes) in the Quarterly review newsletter.
</div> 
<div>
 One member noted that Police requested a “biography” in relation to a request for an import permit by a member of his organisation. The member had written to Police asking if this request was as a result of some policy change in PNHQ. Police responded that there was no policy change with respect to information being sought from applicants as to why they wished to import particular firearms, and Police in attendance did not know about “biographies’ being requested. The forum member passed on the email that he received and Police will follow up on this issue.

        <title>Beverley Forrester Scholarship</title>
        <date>Friday, September 29, 2017</date>
        <img>/images/blog/Beverley_Forrester (2).jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=129</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/blog/Beverley_Forrester (2).jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=129" width="129">A new education scholarship offered by North Canterbury Rural Women New Zealand member, Beverley Forrester has been awarded to physiotherapy student, Travis Henderson from Te Awamutu.</p> 
<p>The $1000 scholarship will contribute towards course costs for Travis to complete a physiotherapy degree at the University of Otago. Travis is in his third year and intends to use the degree to work in rural healthcare. </p>
<p>“Growing up in a family with strong rural connections has given me first hand experience of rural healthcare services,” says Travis. “Once I have finished my degree, I hope to establish a physiotherapy practice in a rural area, with the focus on making healthcare more accessible and affordable for the rural population.”</p> 
<p>Royalties from sales of Beverley Forrester’s book ‘The Farm at Black Hills’ will fund the scholarship. The book is about Beverley's farm and her international fashion brand, which uses wool produced by the corriedale and romney sheep bred on her hill country farm. The fashion garments have featured on the catwalk in New Zealand and overseas.</p> 
<p>Beverley reviewed the scholarship applications and says Travis’ application stood out, as she herself is a qualified Occupational Therapist. “When I did my training, I thought that three years of training and a two-year bond was a lifetime, little knowing that 36 years later I would still be practicing. I wish Travis well on his chosen profession and congratulate him on his success in attaining this scholarship.”</p> 
<p>Two $1000 scholarships are still on offer for applicants undertaking tertiary study in 2018 (criteria apply). <a href="http://ruralwomennewzealand.cmail20.com/t/d-l-uykhuul-ftuhuirhd-y/">Click here to download an entry form</a>. Applications close 28 February 2018.</p>

        <title>Civic Award for Melva Robb and Glenda Robb</title>
        <date>Monday, October 09, 2017</date>
        <img>/Melva and Glenda_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=291</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/Melva and Glenda_web.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=291" width="291">&nbsp;Melva Robb and Glenda Robb are sisters who are very active members of Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) Marlborough Provincial. Marlborough Mayor John Leggett has awarded Civic Honours to the sisters, along with three other Marlborough residents.</p> 
<p>Mr Leggett says the honours are an opportunity to recognise members of the community who give outstanding service to others. <br> </p> 
<p>“The recipients use their skills and energy and give their time and talents to a myriad of organisations and causes. They are serving us all by contributing to the greater good and each deserves our grateful thanks,” he said.</p> 
<p>Severe earthquakes hit on 14 November 2016 affecting rural people in North Canterbury, Kaikōura and South Marlborough. Melva and Glenda spearheaded delivery of relief supplies to remote rural families.They teamed up with the local Rural Support Trust and Federated Farmers, to contact as many residents as they could to assess what was needed other than food.</p> 
<p>“Melva and Glenda’s personal compassion which comes with a loving dollop of practical help, alleviated the sense of isolation and trauma families were experiencing from the Clarence to South Marlborough and the Awatere Valley,” says RWNZ Marlborough member Barbara Stuart. “They took the crisis seriously and did everything in their power to help.”</p> 
<p>Glenda and Melva appealed to RWNZ members and the wider community for donations of crockery and dinner sets. They prepared 100 gift baskets of baking, chocolates and soft toys for children and managed to get supplies onto transport that was headed to isolated areas. They even sent a gift basket via helicopter for a family with a new-born baby, who were isolated at the top of the Awatere Valley.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The other honours recipients this year are Ross Beech, a farmer-environmentalist and a member of the South Marlborough Landscape Restoration Trust; Jim Thomas, a Lions Club member with a record of service to sport and who has a key role in the local Victim Support service, and Henny Vervaart, a Rotary Club member, Red Cross meals-on-wheels volunteer and a valued part of the Alzheimers Marlborough organisation.</p>

        <title>Leptospirosis Society Presentation</title>
        <date>Tuesday, December 12, 2017</date>
        <img>/jackie, janet, fiona ILS.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=259</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/jackie, janet, fiona ILS.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=259" width="259">Rural Women New Zealand National President, Fiona Gower presented at the annual meeting of the International Leptospirosis Society meeting in Palmerston North in late November.</p> 
<p> Her speech is below: “I would not wish this on my worst enemy. I was so ill that I thought I would die.” </p>
<p>“We had to leave the farm, our friends, the kid’s schools and their friends. We bought a house in town facing some fields but it was never the same. We never recovered financially.”</p> 
<p>These are just two quotes from Rural Women New Zealand members when asked to tell their stories about their experience of leptospirosis.</p> 
<p>Leptospirosis is a disease with widespread consequences. What is astounding is the emotional pain that remains long after the physical illness has passed.</p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand too has been involved in the leptospirosis fight, having run two very successful campaigns, the first in the 80’s which raised over $150,000 for research in to leptospirosis in the dairy and pig industry by Massey University. This led to a huge drop in cases as the value of vaccinating stock became well known and implemented.</p> 
<p>In 2007-2008 the second fundraising and awareness campaign was undertaken, raising over $107,000 to be used in the research by Massey into leptospirosis, in particular freezing workers. The awareness raised in groups such as farmers, rural workers and medical professionals was priceless.</p> 
<p>This long term partnership between Massey University and RWNZ representing science and community is incredibly valuable, as it allows the strengths of each to support the work of the other.</p> 
<p>It hasn’t just been the funding and the research, it is the long term partnership that has been the strength, that we can turn to each other for support or backing or information sharing. RWNZ is a member of FLAG – Farmers Leptospirosis Action Group and has attended other Leptospirosis forums. I had the privilege of addressing the NZ Veterinary Association in 2012 on the effects of Leptospirosis on rural families and communities and the importanceof disease prevention to them. </p> 
<p>By working together, we can prevent more cases occurring and having families saying to us: “Our family had to be split up as we were unable to care for the kids. They were strangers by the time we could get them back again. It is really affecting our relationship. Whatever the cost to inoculate, it costs nothing compared to your life.”</p> 
<p>Awareness of the disease which has been raised, and where further work can be done, how to prevent stock getting infected, and importantly what practices rural workers can put into place to lower the risk of them contracting leptospirosis. This is something that community organisations such as Rural Women New Zealand can collaborate on, to raise further awareness to all groups such as rural workers, employers and health professionals. As one rural doctor said after our awareness campaign: “I have never tested much for leptospirosis, but now I will take it more seriously”. We also know that those who have become aware of the disease are more likely to pressure for the test if they are ill.</p> 
<p>The recent very wet weather and floods have shown up cases in those involved in the clean-up, contracting the disease from the infected water and mud. We have been working with Rural Support Trusts to ensure the message is disseminated about staying safe at these times is disseminated is vital. </p> 
<p>Like that famous phrase says, “it won’t happen overnight, but it will happen,” we have seen the results from the combined research and awareness campaigns. Let’s keep it up so less of our stock is infected, meaning better returns for our farmers and less of our rural workers and families contracting leptospirosis, leading to healthier, happy families staying on the land and keeping having strong rural communities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p>
<p>From 1 February, New Zealand Post customers will see the cost of sending untracked parcels to rural addresses increase by $3.70. </p> 
<p>This charge, which was initially only placed on Tracked, Courier and Courier Signature parcels will now also be applied to untracked parcels sent to a rural address as a means to offset fixed costs associated with deliver to rural locations. </p> 
<p>New Zealand Post has stated that these costs are a result of the continuing decrease in letter volumes. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Despite ongoing cost reductions made, this change is said to be necessary to continue to operate a sustainable network. </p> 
<p>For business account customers, the change will take effect on 1 July 2018 as set out in their contacts. </p>

<p>“Overseas experience shows us that farms can be affected by disease outbreak (such as E. coli) through waste left behind by freedom campers and any loss of income is not acceptable to farming families.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Adverse effects on human health and that of our environment are clearly issues for all New Zealanders.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“RWNZ supports the concerns of those communities affected by large numbers of disrespectful freedom campers, especially in tourist hot spots such as Queenstown, Wanaka and others.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“RWNZ believes that the government needs to ensure that the legislation is fit for purpose so that rural areas especially road reserve, paper roads and private land are protected from the adverse effects of freedom camping,” says Ms Gower.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>RURAL WOMEN NEED EQUAL PAY TOO</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
<p>Women working in the rural sector need to be included in the discussions of the reconvened Joint Working Group on Pay Equity Principles says Rural Women New Zealand.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) welcomes the news that the government is keeping its promise to reduce the gender pay gap, and we hope that by reconvening work on this, they include women in the rural sector,” says Board Chair, Penny Mudford.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“The rural sector is male-dominated, there is no doubting that, and our rural women have been working alongside and amongst men as partners for a long time, however for little or no financial reward.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“There are many factors affecting salaries and wages of rural women, some which are particular to our farming women, particularly when they are also the primary caregiver.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“RWNZ urges the Joint Working Group to consider principles which will reduce the gender pay gap in our farming sector,” says Ms Mudford.</p>

        <title>Another Preventable Rural Tragedy</title>
        <date>Thursday, February 01, 2018</date>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“It is very sad, but it need not have occurred. We need to prevent families and friends from the heartbreak of losing a loved one in such tragic circumstances,” says National President, Fiona Gower.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“RWNZ are concerned on two levels, one is children riding age appropriate quad bikes unsupervised and the other is children under the age of 16 riding adult-sized quad bikes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Last nights’ incident is an unfortunate but timely reminder of manufacturers recommendations that children under the age of 16 should not be riding adult-sized quad bikes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Children do not have the weight, strength or judgement to be operating these vehicles.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Or if young children are riding age appropriate quad bikes, they need to be wearing a helmet and be supervised at all times.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“RWNZ encourage that anyone planning to use any form of machinery on farms receive training, and learn safe practices.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“It is heart breaking to receive news like this,” says Ms. Gower.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/hero_vote-008.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=415" width="415" style="color: rgb(1, 170, 163); font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">It is exciting to have a busy year of activities for the 125th Anniversary of Women's Suffrage, and celebrating the diverse women who have been championing social change in New Zealand? <br> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Now, as we remember, celebrate and look to the future, the Ministry for Women, Te Minitatanga mō ngā Wāhine is proud to be coordinating activities and events which will mark this significant milestone. These celebrations will recognise New Zealanders from diverse cultural backgrounds that have contributed to progressing women’s rights.</p>

        <title>Rural Women Renew Call For Bus Signs</title>
        <date>Wednesday, February 07, 2018</date>

<p>RURAL WOMEN RENEW CALL FOR BUS SIGNS <br> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>RWNZ have released a press release calling for changes to be made to improve the safety of children, especially those living in rural areas.&nbsp; <br> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As schools return this week, Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) is reminding drivers about their legal responsibilities and renewing their call for mandatory signage and flashing lights on school buses.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“RWNZ urges the new Government to implement mandatory 20km/h signs and flashing lights on school buses, especially given recent trials have proven both are vital to reducing the speed of traffic passing school buses,” says National President, Fiona Gower.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Rural children are especially vulnerable when drivers speed past school buses, and children have been involved in a number of serious and fatal incidents.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“We are back into the swing of the school year, and drivers must remember to follow the Road Code and slow down to 20km/h when passing a school bus that has stopped to pick-up or drop-off children.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“As advocates of safer rural roads, RWNZ also asks drivers to watch out for children cycling or walking to school, particularly along highways and main roads, and always remember to slow down to the speed limits indicated in school zones.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“It is time to up the game with keeping our rural children safe – let's just do it,” says Ms Gower.'</p>

        <title>Rural Women Need Access to Midwifery Care</title>
        <date>Thursday, February 15, 2018</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>RWNZ has responded to recent media regarding the loss of a working midwife in the Wanaka region.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RURAL WOMEN NEED ACCESS TO MIDWIFERY CARE</strong> </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) is very concerned that Wanaka is soon to lose one of the community’s two midwives.</p> 
<p>“Midwives practicing in rural communities have long battled the problems of geographical isolation in areas where the population continues to grow,” says Board Member and Health Portfolio Convenor, Margaret Pittaway.</p> 
<p>“Resourcing has been lacking for so long that rural families are suffering – it is absolutely unacceptable that expectant mothers and their families have been placed in the firing line.</p> 
<p>“This lack of resourcing and recognition for the travel costs faced by these midwives results in a work load that is unbearable.</p> 
<p>“The Netherlands are leading the way in maternal care which RWNZ wants to see considered here.</p> 
<p>“RWNZ urges the Government to act quickly to ensure every community can provide the maternity services needed.</p> 
<p> “Our rural women, babies, and communities are in desperate need of support,” says Mrs Pittaway.</p>

        <title>CSW62 New York</title>
        <date>Thursday, February 22, 2018</date>
        <img>/csw62.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=465</img>
        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/csw62.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=465" width="465">Each year, the United Nations (UN) holds the Commission of the Status of Women (CSW). This year will be the 62nd event and is being hosted in New York on 10 – 23 March, and will be attended by over 5000 women from across the world. <br> </p> 
<p>‘Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Rural Women and Girls’ is this years’ theme. Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) has been recognised as a leading authoritative voice for rural women and their communities, and consequently we were recommended to attend by the Human Rights Commission (HRC).</p> 
<p>In collaboration between the HRC and RWNZ, a side event has been applied for and approved. The New Zealand Government is sponsoring this event in conjunction with the another Government, which at this stage may be Argentina (yet to be confirmed), and will be held inside the UN. The subject for the presentation is <em>Case Studies for Economic Empowerment of Rural Women from New Zealand. </em> </p> 
<p>This panel will include Minster for Women - Hon Julie Anne Genter, RWNZ National President Fiona Gower, RWNZ member and Chair of the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women - Traci Houpapa MNZM, Fonterra's General Manager NZ Industry Affairs - Joanne Finer, and a delegate representing another Government (yet to be confirmed). The panel will be moderated by Human Rights Commissioner - Dr Jackie Blue, and also attended by ACWW World President - Ruth Shanks.</p> 
<p>A <em>side event</em> is held within the UN complex, and a<em> parallel event</em> is one in various venues outside of the UN complex - organised through the NGO CSW Committee.</p> 
<p><img src="/Fiona, Penny.JPG?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=425" width="425"> </p> 
<p>(<em>Pictured above: (left) National President - Fiona Gower, (right) National Chair - Penny Mudford)</em> </p> 
<p>Fiona will be attending CSW62 as a member of the Pacific Women's Watch (NZ) delegation, and our National Chair, Penny Mudford, is attending as the Civil Society Representative on the New Zealand Government Delegation. Both Fiona and Penny will be attending the NGO Consultation Day, as well as other CSW62 side and parallel events over the 12 days that they are in New York. </p> 
<p>Fiona and Penny will support the launch of the ACWW "Rural Women's Survey" which is to take place in New York on 15 March. </p> 
<p>This is an exciting opportunity for RWNZ, especially being part of an international forum which will be highlighting the issues rural women face. It will also showcase the ingenuity, enterprise and abilities of our rural women to succeed, how they have overcome challenges to run successful enterprise in rural and remote areas, and how they have become empowered to become leaders in rural New Zealand. They will be able to discuss other challenges facing those living rurally and look for answers which will enable more of our women and girls to reach their potential.</p> 
<p>The networking is well underway, connecting with other NGO’s and delegates attending CSW62, with a number of opportunities to give presentations and advice as a leading voice for rural women. This includes Fiona speaking to the Aotearoa Youth Leadership Institute who are sending a team of extremely talented young women. </p> 
<p>Fiona and Penny will take every opportunity to report back on happenings over there to keep members well informed of progress. We wish them all the best for their travels to New York.</p>

        <title>Fairfax Decision Will Damage Rural Communities</title>

<p>(<i>Pictured Above: National President Fiona Gower)&nbsp;</i> </p> 
<p><i>&nbsp;</i>RWNZ have responded to the recent news that Stuff is to close or sell 28 regional, provincial and rural newspapers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Please read the media response as follows.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>FAIRFAX DECISION WILL DAMAGE RURAL COMMUNITIES</strong> </p> 
<p>Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ) is shocked to hear that Fairfax is considering closing, or selling 28 regional, provincial and rural newspapers.</p> 
<p>“The announcement today from Fairfax that 28 of their mastheads will be closing or sold to instead concentrate on digital revenue is short-sighted and irresponsible at best,” says National President, Fiona Gower.</p> 
<p>“Rural, regional, and provincial newspapers and magazines are the lifeblood of New Zealand’s rural communities - many of which have little or no internet access.</p> 
<p>“To rationalise rural and smaller community newspapers to deliver additional EBITDA by driving digital revenue shows a complete lack of understanding in the vital role of print in our rural communities.</p> 
<p>“This decision by Fairfax means that the elderly and those without internet capability who rely on newspapers for news, public notices and other information, will miss out.</p> 
<p>"This significant loss will result in further isolation for those living in rural areas.</p> 
<p>“The last thing we need is to starve the rural sector of oxygen by shutting down newspapers, especially since everyday access to internet is not a reality for many of those who live in our rural communities.</p> 
<p>“We are already seeing a decline in local and rural coverage, and today’s announcement by Fairfax is yet another lost opportunity to celebrate rural businesses and the rural women who contribute so much to their local community and economy.</p> 
<p>“With this devastating news, I can’t help but ponder – what were they thinking?”, says Ms Gower.</p>

        <title>Census Data Collection Integrity Questioned</title>
        <date>Monday, February 26, 2018</date>
        <body><![CDATA[<p>Rural Women New Zealand have released a media release raising our concerns for how data is being collected in this year's census. <br> </p>

  <p><strong>CENSUS DATA COLLECTION INTEGRITY QUESTIONED</strong> </p> 
  <p>This year’s census is in danger of not providing the data needed to make good decisions, says Rural Women New Zealand (RWNZ).</p> 
  <p>“Whilst we understand and support the excitement of capturing our census data online, our concern is that many people still do not have access to internet while others might not have the capability or capacity to do so,” says National President, Fiona Gower.</p> 
  <p>“The timing of the delivery of access code letters, which indicate that New Zealanders can opt for paper forms presents challenges for our rural communities, given that delivery of mail is taking longer and might only be delivered three days a week.</p> 
  <p>“The chances of a rural household without internet or with unreliable internet, receiving census paper forms in time for Tuesday, 6 March is slim, and that is concerning.</p> 
  <p>“RWNZ is doing everything possible to ensure our networks are aware of the new way of doing the Census although surely more thought should have gone in to how the valuable information about the lives and status of New Zealanders would be collected.</p> 
  <p>“Maybe this year, there could have been a concerted effort to use both electronic collection and paper collection to ensure integrity of the data,” says Ms Gower.</p>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><img src="/International-Womens-Day.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional&amp;width=246" width="246">Today -Thursday, 8 March celebrates International Women’s Day. A breakfast at Parliament this morning saw 400 women the attend to hear the Governor General, the Right Honourable Dame Patsy Reddy, the Minister for Women, Hon Julie Anne Genter, and Rt Hon Helen Clark, who had a 40-minute discussion with Dr Gill Greer.</p> 
<p>The event was jointly organised by the UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand, and the Zonta Club of Wellington.</p> 
<p>Topics of discussion at the breakfast included the direction of women in leadership, celebrating the progress that has been made in New Zealand, the impact of social movements including the #metoo campaign and how movements such these which start off small on social media, can eventuate into a real drive for change. </p> 
<p>RWNZ was lucky enough be present at the event and meet such inspirational leaders. We look forward to participating in more events celebrating the successes of women and discussing our future direction in finding full equality. </p>
